This report will detail the motivation for measuring the Higgs boson decaying to a pair of b quarks.
First the ATLAS detector will described in enough detail such that the capabilities and limitations of that hardware
can be referred to when discussing the analysis. Then the physics theory which predicts the decay in question, the
standard model of particle physics, is described including a short review of physical phenomena that are measured to
exist but not included within the model. Following these foundational detials the strategy for the main analayis is
laid out. Due to the fact that the current iteration of this analysis is now finished details given will be those
most relevant to possible future improvements of the analysis. Finally the results will be shown of work that has
been completed on quantifying the uncertainty of a specific systematic error associated with the single-top
background.
