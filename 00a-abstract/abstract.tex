\begin{abstract}
  Proton-proton collisions with centre of mass energy of 13~\TeV\ are analysed
  in order to measure the \VHbb\ process. These collisions are provided by the
  Large Hadron Collider and measured by the ATLAS detector both of which are
  based at CERN. The \VHbb\ process occurs when a Higgs boson is produced in
  association with a vector boson and decays to a pair of $b$-quarks. Both the
  \VH\ production mechanism and the \Hbb\ decay channel were first measured in
  2018 by the ATLAS and CMS collaboration. This subsequent measurement of the
  \VHbb\ process aims to further our understanding of the Higgs by providing
  more precise measurements of the \VH\ signal strength as well as the
  individual \WH\ and \ZH\ signal strengths, further testing the predictions of
  The Standard Model of Particle Physics. The analysis uses a number of by-hand
  categorisations as well as a multi-variate classifier to obtain distributions
  that enter into a profile-likelihood fit. The results of the analysis
  performed using the full run 2 dataset (140~fb$^{-1}$ recorded between
  2015--2018) agree with the standard model predictions for signal strength and
  cross-section in a number of fiducial regions.
