\begin{abstract}
  Proton-proton collisions with centre of mass energy of 13~\TeV are analysed in
  order to measure the $V\!H \to b\bar{b}$ process. These collisions are provided
  by the Large Hadron Collider and measured by the ATLAS detector both of which
  are based at CERN. The $VH \to b\bar{b}$ process occurs when a Higgs boson is
  produced in association with a vector boson and decays to a pair of
  $b$-quarks. Both the $V\!H VH$ production mechanism and the $H \to b\bar{b}$ decay
  channel were first measured in 2018 by the ATLAS and CMS collaboration.
  This subsequent measurement of the $VH \to b\bar{b}$ process aims to further
  our understanding of the Higgs by providing more precise measurements of the
  $VH$ signal strength as well as the individual $WH$ and $ZH$ signal strengths,
  further testing the predictions of The Standard Model of Particle Physics. The
  analysis uses a number of by-hand categorisations as well as a multi-variate
  classifier to obtain distributions that enter into a profile-likelihood fit.
  The results of the analysis performed using the full run 2 dataset
  (140~fb$^{-1}$ recorded between 2015--2018) agree with the standard model
  predictions for signal strength and cross-section in a number of fiducial
  regions.
