% In 2012 the Higgs boson was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at
% the Large Hadron Collider~\cite{DiscoHiggsATLAS, DiscoHiggsCMS}. It was said to
% form the last piece of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, a framework that
% describes three of the four fundamental forces of nature, described in more
% detail in Chapter~\ref{sec:theory}. Despite apparent completeness after the
% Higgs discovery, it is known that the theory does not describe gravity, the
% fourth of the known fundamental forces of nature. The theory also has other
% shortcomings, it cannot explain the presence of dark matter~\cite{DM-ev-sloan,
%   DM-ev-nucleosynth, DM-ev-supernova, DM-ev-scaffold, DM-ev-direct,
%   DM-ev-strong-lens, DM-ev-candidates, DM-ev-PDG, DM-ev-Zwicky,
%   DM-ev-nonbaryonic, DM-ev-particle} or a number of other observed
% phenomena~\cite{anom-BD-branching, anom-Dtau-excess, anom-g-2,
%   anom-proton-radius, anom-bsll-trans}. So far the model has stood up to all
% experimental tests~\cite{EWtests, 1998-SMtests} concerning its own predictions
% but there are still parameters of the model that have not been measured. Given
% the theory's understood shortcomings, it is hoped that continued scrutiny of the
% models predictions will yield unexpected results, perhaps hinting at a new
% way forwards in terms of a theory that describes everything or simply exposing
% further gaps in our knowledge of the universe. For this reason it is more
% important than ever to study in detail the most recently discovered piece of the
% model, the Higgs boson.

% This work focuses on studying a specific production mechanism and decay mode of
% the Higgs boson, specifically a vector boson associated Higgs boson decaying to
% two bottom quarks, denoted $VH(bb)$. This decay mode is of importance as it is
% currently the only decay mode of the Higgs decaying to quarks that has been
% observed~\cite{vhbb-obs}. A summary of the full spectrum of production
% mechanisms and decay modes of the Higgs will be given in
% Chapter~\ref{sec:theory}.

% The study of this decay mode was carried out with the ATLAS detector, and made
% possible by the hard work of all members of the ATLAS collaboration. In
% Chapter~\ref{sec:detector} the detector is described in full.
