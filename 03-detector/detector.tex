 \chapter{The ATLAS Detector at the Large Hadron Collider}%
\label{sec:detector}

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}%
\label{sec:lhc}%
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{LHC-dr} is a large circular machine
located 100~m underground straddling the Swiss-French border at the European
Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN). The machine is primarily a proton
collider~\footnote{The LHC also collides other charged particles such as ions of
  lead of xenon.} and is circular in design so that protons may be accelerated
over many revolutions to high energies before being allowed to collide. The
diameter or the LHC is 27~km, the tunnel in which the machine resides was
originally excavated for the LEP~\cite{LEP} experiment and at the time was the
largest civil engineering project in Europe. There are many experiments at CERN
all with the goal of improving our understanding of a particular area of
physics some of which are marked in figure.~\ref{fig:lhc-acc}. In particular
there are seven experiments that record data from the collisions at the LHC:
ATLAS~\cite{ATLAS-loi}, CMS~\cite{CMS-loi}, LHCb~\cite{lhcb-loi},
ALICE~\cite{ALICE-loi}, MoEDAL~\cite{MoEDAL-loi}, TOTEM~\cite{TOTEM-loi} and
LHCf~\cite{lhcf-loi}.

  \label{fig:lhc-acc}
\end{figure}

The LHC receives protons that have already been accelerated somewhat by the
Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), another of the accelerators at the CERN
accelerator complex shown in figure~\ref{fig:lhc-acc}. The circular design of
both the LHC and SPS allows protons to be accelerated many times around their
respective rings until their velocity is fast enough for a high energy
collision. The highest energy collisions achieved at the time of writing take
place at a centre of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13 $~TeV, although the design
energy of the LHC is $\sqrt{s} = 14 $~TeV. Despite having not yet reached is
design energy the LHC collides particles with the highest energy of any particle
collider in history and is currently alone at the energy frontier of modern
physics. At the time of writing the LHC is in it's second long shutdown during
which maintenance and upgrades to the LHC and the particle detectors located
around its ring take place. The LHC has completed two main runs of collisions
Run 1 took place between 2009 and 2013, followed  by a long shutdown period and
then Run 2 between 2015 and 2018. Many analyses from Run 1 have been published
including most notably the discovery of the Higgs boson~\cite{DiscoHiggsATLAS,
  DiscoHiggsCMS}. Some Run 2 analyses have also published results notably LHCb's
discovery of charge parity violation in charm decays~\cite{cp-charm}. Despite
these impactful results there are many more results expected from the LHC
experiments as data continues to be analysed.

The statistical nature of particle physics analyses means that larger datasets
(more recorded collisions) increase the sensitivity of searches and
measurements. Constraints on the number of years the LHC is able to run for mean
that the best way to record more collisions is to collide more particles per
second. A quantity known as the luminosity is often used to describe how much
data is available for an analysis, it is written as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:luminosity}
  L = \frac{1}{\sigma}\frac{dN}{dt},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the interaction cross-section, a volume within which particles
must pass by one another in order to interact, and $N$ is the number of events
recorded in a period of time $t$. For luminosity at the LHC N can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lhc-lumi}
  N = n_{bp}n_{1}n_{2}\nu_{r},
\end{equation}
where $n_{bp}$ is the number of colliding bunch pairs, $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are
the number of protons in each beam and $\nu_r$ is the frequency with which the
beams rotate around the LHC's circumference. It is clear that to increase
luminosity any one of these parameters can be increased. The LHC has already
exceeded it's design luminosity providing physicists with more data to analyse
than expected and plans are well underway for the upgrade to a High-Luminosity
LHC (HL-LHC)~\cite{hilumi-tdr}.

\section{The ATLAS Detector}%
\label{sec:atlas}

The ATLAS detector~\cite{ATLAS} resides at a location on the LHC ring called
Point 1, its full name is A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS. A diagram of the detector is
shown in figure~\ref{fig:ATLAS-det}. ATLAS is considered to be a general purpose
particle detector and has a wide physics program including: Higgs boson physics,
top quark physics, searches for Supersymmetry and exotic states, probes of CP
violation in b-quarks and light states and heavy ion physics. The work in this
report is concerned with the measurement of products from proton-proton
collisions. The detector itself is very large in size, spanning a width of 25~m
and a length of 44~m and weighs 7000~tonnes which is comparable to the weight of
the wrought iron content of the Eiffel tower~\cite{Eiffel-weight}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{ATLAS-detector}
  \caption{Computer generated image of the whole ATLAS detector with the major sub detectors
    labeled~\cite{ATLAS-det-fig}.}%
  \label{fig:ATLAS-det}
\end{figure}


Due to the composite nature of the proton, the decay products of collisions are
extremely numerous. Additionally when two bunches of protons cross there is the
chance that more than one hard scattering event occurs and softer glancing
collisions are also a possibility. The number of hard scattering events in a
given bunch crossing is known as the pile-up of the collision and is often
denoted with the symbol $\mu$. As can be seen by inspecting
equation~\ref{eq:lhc-lumi} increasing the luminosity will often cause a higher
pile-up environment in the detector. High pile-up, along with the numerous decay
products of each collision necessitate the use of specialised sub-detectors in
order to accurately measure the output of collisions. For certain types of
decay product there are different dedicated sub-systems in ATLAS with the
purpose of measuring properties of particles of that type. At this stage it is
sufficient to say that the treatment of electrically charged particles must be
different to those that are electrically neutral but this concept will be
expanded upon in more detail in the further sections. It is interesting to note
that despite the many charges that are associated with the forces of nature
discussed in chapter~\ref{sec:theory} the only one that we can directly measure
is electric charge\footnote{This is true for current human technology, it is not
  known if future or alien technology can access other charges.}.

The ATLAS sub-systems are located in either the barrel of the detector or one of
the end-caps. These two areas have a different geometry and so the design of a
sub-system in the barrel will differ from the same sub-system in the end-cap.
What follows is a description of the ATLAS sub-systems and their individual
components, for each component more detail will be given about which properties
of which types of particles it is used to measure. These details are based on
the ATLAS technical design report volumes~\cite{ATLAS-TDR-01, ATLAS-TDR-02}
unless another citation is present. Before detailing individual components it is
important to detail certain properties of the detector relevant to all
sub-systems.  The coordinate system used to describe the ATLAS detector is known
as right-handed. Three orthogonal axes $(x, y, z)$ are used to describe the 3D
space of the detector. The x-axis points towards the centre of the LHC ring, the
y-axis points upwards and the z-axis points along the LHC beam pipe y-axis. The
three axes meet at the interaction point which is the nominal position where
bunches cross, located in the centre of the detector. Cylindrical coordinates
$(r, \phi)$ are also often used to describe the physical features of the
detector and phenomena caused by interactions in the detector that shall be
referred to as analysis objects. Their definitions are that $\phi$ is the
azimuthal angle in the x-y plane (transverse) around the beam pipe and $r$ is
the distance from the interaction point. A final quantity used due to its
compatibility with description relativistic objects in the detector is
pseudo-rapidity $\eta = - \ln(\tan(\theta / 2))$ where $\theta$ is the zenith
angle measured from the z-axis.

The grouping of particles into electrically charged or neutral is largely due to
the fact charged particles experience the Lorentz force
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lorentz}
  \vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}),
\end{equation}
whereas neutral particles have $q=0$, and so they do not. The magnetic field
$\vec{B}$ has the effect of changing the direction of the particles trajectory
only. This is due to the fact that any force $\vec{F}$ resulting from the cross
product of two vectors, in this case the field vector and the velocity $\vec{v}$,
much act in a perpendicular to the two crossed vectors and thus perpendicular to
the direction of the motion (the direction of velocity). Similarly the electric
field term $\vec{E}$ has the effect that the particle is accelerated in the
direction (or opposite in the case of a negative particle) of the field lines.
The consequence of this is that in a known magnetic field the velocity of a
particle can be calculated by measuring the radius of curvature of its
trajectory. It also means that magnetic fields can be used to alter a particles
path through a detection medium so that it passes through a greater amount of
material than in the situation where its path was straight. In order to exploit
these properties of charged particles a large portion of the ATLAS detector is
immersed in magnetic fields created by the magnet systems. There are four magnet
systems in ATLAS the solenoid, the barrel toroid, and two end-cap toroids. The
solenoid surrounds the inner detector whilst the toroid systems surround the
muon chambers. Figure~\ref{fig:ATLAS-magnets} shows a heat map of the magnetic
field strengths within ATLAS, the image is from an article detailing the
superconducting magnet system~\cite{ATLAS-magnets}. The magnet systems store a
total energy of 1.6~GJ and produce fields of a combined volume of approximately
$12\times 10^4$~m$^3$.

    the centre of the detector (a), and a longitudinal section
    (b)~\cite{ATLAS-magnets}.}%
  \label{fig:ATLAS-magnets}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Inner Detector}%
\label{sec:id}

The Inner Detector (ID) is comprised of pixel detectors, the semiconductor
tracker (SCT) and a transition radiation tracker (TRT) as seen in
figure~\ref{fig:ATLAS-inner-det}. It covers a volume corresponding with the
total $\phi$ angle. In relation to $\eta$ the pixel detectors and SCT cover the
range $|\eta|~<~2.5$ and the TRT covers $|\eta|~<~2.0$. Being the innermost
sub-detector of ATLAS the primary goals of the ID are to reconstruct the
locations of the origin of interactions (known as the interaction vertex), and
to track the propagation of charged particles through the detector. This is
achieved by measuring a sequence of hits for each charged particle that
propagates through its material, upon which reconstruction algorithms can be
applied known as track finding algorithms. From this sequence of hits
interaction vertices can also be reconstructed, the vertex which comes from the
highest energy collision in a given event is known as the primary vertex. By
using the combined information the vertices and tracks decay products in more
outer regions of the detector can be matched with their vertices. Each
reconstructed track will have a momentum assigned to it, which is calculated
using equation~\ref{eq:lorentz}. The magnetic field that the ID is immersed in
is produced by the solenoid magnet system. The system is made of a single layer
coil with an inner diameter of 2.46~m  and produces 2~T field in the axial
direction with respect to the beam-pipe.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{Inner-detector}
  \caption{Computer generated image of the ATLAS inner
    detector~\cite{ATLAS-inner-det}.}%
  \label{fig:ATLAS-inner-det}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Pixel Detectors}

There are four layers of pixel detectors that are the closest components of the
ID to the beam-pipe. The design originally had three layers, each 250~$\mu$m
thick with 50~$\mu$m by 250~$\mu$m pixels, of oxygen doped n-type silicon
crystals. During the first long shutdown a fourth layer, closest to the
beam-pipe (which was also replaced for a smaller radius version) was added. This
layer is known as the insertable B-layer (IBL)~\cite{IBL-TDR}, the motivation
for its addition was to maintain the existing performance of the ID despite
irreversible damage to the original three pixel layers due to heavy radiation
exposure. As well as the inclusion of the IBL performance degradation will be
mitigated by increasing the bias voltage across the pixels from 100~V (their
starting voltage) to up to 600~V. There are no pixel detectors in the end-caps.

\subsubsection{Semiconductor Tracker}

Next closest to the beam-pipe are the semiconductor trackers. Similarly to the pixel
detectors the semiconductor trackers are also made of silicon. In contrast the
n-type silicon of the pixels, the semiconductor trackers use p-in-n type
technology. The semiconductor modules are comprised of two back to back silicon
wafers that are offset by a small angle in order to improve coverage. Each wafer
has a series of strips of p-in-type material covered in a metalised layer, the
strips are separated by a distance of 80~$\mu$m. The strips have a bias voltage
applied and on the wafers the necessary electronics are mounted for readout as seen in
figure~\ref{fig:strip-module}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{sct-module}
  \caption{An image of an SCT long strip module mounted in a rig for testing at
    Queen Mary Univesity of London.}
  \label{fig:strip-module}
\end{figure}
In order to calibrate the response of the strips a 100~M$\Omega$ poly-silicon
resistor is located at the end of each strip. Figure~\ref{fig:sct-close} shows an
image of the snake-like structure of a poly-silicon resistor from the end of an
SCT module.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{sct-close}
  \caption{A close up image of the end of an SCT sensor in which the snake-like
    poly-silicon reistors are visible as a yellowish coloured structure at the
    end of each strip. This image was taken with a high resolution automatic
    area scanner commissioned by the author~\cite{itk-scanner} in order to take
    full scans of strip sensors during the production of the ATLAS Inner
    Detector upgrade known as the Inner Tracker (ITk)~\cite{itk-tdr,
      itk-strips-tdr}.}
  \label{fig:sct-close}
\end{figure}
The modules come in two different designs, short strips and long
strips with the short strips forming the layer closest to the pixel detectors
and the long strips on the outside.



The
original operating bias voltage was 150~V but again due to radiation exposure
this will raise to up to 350~V over time as necessary. There are four layers of
semiconductor trackers in the barrel arranged so that sensors have a tilt with
respect to a perfect coaxial cylinders of approximately 11~$\degree$. This tilt
increases the amount of material that particles will travel through and is
optimized to the geometry of the detector. Similarly the end-cap modules are
arranged in petal like structures, with a number of different geometric designed
based on the position within the end-cap.

\subsubsection{Transition Radiation Tracker}

The final layer of the ID is the TRT, the primary role of the TRT is to aid
electron identification by measurement of transition radiation. The TRT is
mostly made up of polyimide drift tubes with a diameter of 4~mm. The drift tubes
are filled with a gas mixture whose majority constituent is xenon. These tubes
operate with a voltage of -1530~V and are contained within a carbon fibre
support structure. The geometric layout of the tubes is optimized for
both the barrel and end-caps.



\subsection{Calorimeters}%
\label{sec:calo}

The purpose of the calorimeters is two-fold, firstly the measure the energy of
particles that pass all the way through the ID, and secondly to act as a barrier
to stop charged particles passing through to the muon spectrometers (apart from
muons). There are two calorimeter systems in ATLAS the electromagnetic
calorimeter (ECAL) and the hadronic calorimeter (HCAL), they will be explained
in the following sections. The calorimeters are not immersed in a significant magnetic
field compared to the rest of the ATLAS as seen in the heat map of
figure~\ref{fig:ATLAS-magnets}. This is because measuring the energy of
particles and acting as a barrier to them does not require curved trajectories.
The geometric layout of the calorimeter systems, as well as the location of
specific components can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:ATLAS-calo}, in which the ID
can also be seen (greyed out). Information from the two calorimeters is used in
conjunction for any particles whose decay products propagate through both
volumes. Both calorimeters are split up into cells of material that are used to
determine the position of decay products in the detector.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{ATLAS-calo}
  \caption{Computer Generated image of the ATLAS
    calorimeter~\cite{ATLAS-calo-fig}.}%
  \label{fig:ATLAS-calo}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
The ECAL is primarily concerned with measuring the energy and stopping the
trajectory of electrons and photons. It has liquid argon (LAr) as it's active
material. Particles initiate an electromagnetic shower of decay products in the
active material which ionizes it. An applied electric field causes these ions to
drift in such a way that the current induced proportional to the energy
deposited by the incident particle.

\subsubsection{Hadronic Calorimeter}
The HCAL also has a LAr component which works in a similar way to that of the
ECAL but with different optimizations for the HCAL's specialised design. The
HCAL is specifically tasked with measuring the energy and stopping the
trajectory of hadrons. The HCAL also contains a tile calorimeter which uses
scintillation light produced in the tiles as a means to measure the deposited
energy of hadrons. 

\subsection{Muon Spectrometers}%
\label{sec:muon}

Surrounding the calorimeters are the muon spectrometers, which form the most
outer layer of the detector. Though muons are charged leptons just like
electrons, their specific properties mean that dedicated muon spectrometers are
required to detect them. Muons deposit far less energy per distance traveled
than other particles meaning that they punch through most materials with ease.
As can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:ATLAS-muon} the components of the muon
spectrometers are the thin-gap chambers, cathode strip chambers, resistive plate
chambers and monitor drift tubes. The barrel and end-cap toroid magnets immerse
the muon spectrometers in a magnetic field which at its peak (visible in
figure~\ref{fig:ATLAS-magnets}) has a strength of 4~T. Despite a stronger
peaking magnetic field than in the solenoid observed muon tracks are often far
less curved that that of their lighter cousins the electrons. This is due to the
increased mass of the muon. Muons do leave tracks in the ID and also deposit
small amount of energy in the calorimeters. Tracks in the muon spectrometers are
matched up to tracks in the ID with the aid of the location of energy deposits
in the calorimeters if possible. The full tracking information for muons can be
used in algorithms such as overlap removal, which is used to remove muons from
jets that they have been erroneously associated with by matching the muon with
its ID track.

    subsystem~\cite{ATLAS-muon-fig}.}%
  \label{fig:ATLAS-muon}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Trigger Systems}%
\label{sec:trigger}

The trigger systems in ATLAS allows data to be recorded only when an event meets
certain criteria. Without triggering there would be no way to decide which
events to readout and which to ignore. It would be impossible to readout every
interaction that occurs in the detector. The reason for this is that the
geometric constraints of the detector mean that there is only a small space
available for readout wires, as detection medium needs to be prioritized for
sensitivity and technology limits the data rate that one can achieve through a
cable of fixed area. The trigger system comes in two parts, hardware component
referred to as level one (L1) and software component referred to as the high
level trigger (HLT). The L1 system is comprised of the L1 calorimeter (L1Calo)
trigger which operates by searching for clusters of energy in the calorimeters
and the L1 muon (L1Muon) system which coincidences in the muon systems. A third
system L1 topological (L1Topo) uses regions of interest built from the L1Calo
and L1Muon data which are passed to central trigger processors for selection.
The various limitations of the hardware mean that these selections must be
passed up to the next level of triggering, the HLT in a time window of
2.5~$\mu$s. The HLT takes information from the L1 systems and uses faster
versions of an offline style analysis in order to select or reject events for
readout. Events must pass fully the trigger of one of the algorithms defined by
an extensive trigger menu. More information about the triggers used in the
$VH(bb)$ analysis will be given in a later chapter.
