  \caption[Magnets in a dipole configuration.]{A representation of a pair of
    idealised cylindrical magnets in a dipole configuration. Two positively
    charged particles are shown as circles, the red particle is traveling out of
    the page, the green particle is traveling into the page. The forces
    experienced by each particle due to the magnetic field are shown as blue
    arrows.}
