    idealised set of coil magnets in a quadrupole configuration with a proton
    beamspot shown as a red ellipse. The proton beam is drawn coming out of the
    page (\emph{watch out!}), magnetic field lines are drawn in black and the
    forces acting on each bunch of protons are drawn as blue arrows.}
