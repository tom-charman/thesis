\chapter{Analysis Strategy}%
\label{ch:strategy}
In the previous chapter the process of reconstruction and selection was
described. With the objects required for this analysis reconstructed and an
event selection in place an analysis strategy is formed in order to maximise the
signal strength of the VH(bb) process and yield a robust result that is well
understood in terms of modelling and systematic errors. In this chapter that
strategy will be detailed, first the categorisation into analysis regions will
be defined, next the multi-variate algorithm that is used to generate some of
the distributions entering into the profile-likelihood fit will be explained.
Plots of the data versus Monte-Carlo prediction will then be shown in order to
build a picture of the pre-fit status of the agreement. Finally a series of
cross-checks which are used to validate the methods of the analysis will be
explained.

The author's contributions include studying the behaviour of the
profile-likelihood fit with the inclusion of these regions, which are new in
this round of the analysis and making comparisons between the 80~\invfb and
140~\invfb datasets). Contributions also include the training of the
multi-variate classification algorithm with the inclusion of new input variables
with respect to the previous version of the algorithm.

\section{Categorisation into Analysis Regions}
\label{sec:ana-regions}

Events which pass the selection detailed in table~\ref{tab:event-selection} are
categorised into several regions for analysis. Firstly they are split into what
are known as medium ($75 - 150 \GeV$), high ($150 - 250 \GeV$) and extreme ($ >
250 \GeV$) $p_T^{V}$.


Choice of pTV and nJets per channel.
Which backgrounds are present in which channels.
Which samples are used to simulate which backgrounds.

Mention VZ and cut-based cross checks so I can refer to them in the systematics
chapter.
