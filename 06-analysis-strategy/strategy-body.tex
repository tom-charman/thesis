\chapter{Analysis Strategy}%
\label{ch:strategy}
In the previous chapter the process of reconstruction and selection was
described. With the objects required for this analysis reconstructed and an
event selection in place an analysis strategy is formed in order to maximise the
signal strength of the VH(bb) process and yield a robust result that is well
understood in terms of modelling and systematic errors. In this chapter that
strategy will be detailed, first the categorisation into analysis regions will
be defined, next the multi-variate algorithm that is used to generate some of
the distributions entering into the profile-likelihood fit will be explained.
Plots of the data versus Monte-Carlo prediction will then be shown in order to
build a picture of the pre-fit status of the agreement. Finally a series of
cross-checks which are used to validate the methods of the analysis will be
explained.

The author's contributions include studying the behaviour of the
profile-likelihood fit with the inclusion of these new regions (and making
comparisons between the 80~\invfb and 140~\invfb datasets). The

Mention VZ and cut-based cross checks so I can refer to them in the systematics
chapter.
