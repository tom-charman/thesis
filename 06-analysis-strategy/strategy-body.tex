\chapter{Analysis Strategy}%
\label{ch:strategy}
In the previous chapter the process of reconstruction and selection was
described. With the objects required for this analysis reconstructed and an
event selection in place an analysis strategy is formed in order to maximise the
signal strength of the VH(bb) process and yield a robust result that is well
understood in terms of modelling and systematic errors. In this chapter that
strategy will be detailed, first the categorisation into analysis regions will
be defined, next the multi-variate algorithm that is used to generate some of
the distributions entering into the profile-likelihood fit will be explained.
Plots of the data versus Monte-Carlo prediction will then be shown in order to
build a picture of the pre-fit status of the agreement. Finally a series of
cross-checks which are used to validate the methods of the analysis will be
explained.

The author's contributions include studying the behaviour of the
profile-likelihood fit with the inclusion of these regions, which are new in
this round of the analysis and making comparisons between the 80~\invfb and
140~\invfb datasets). Contributions also include the training of the
multi-variate classification algorithm with the inclusion of new input variables
with respect to the previous version of the algorithm.

\section{Categorisation into Analysis Regions}
\label{sec:ana-regions}

Events which pass the selection detailed in table~\ref{tab:event-selection} are
categorised into several regions for analysis. Firstly they are split into what
are known as medium ($75 - 150 \GeV$), high ($150 - 250 \GeV$) and extreme ($ >
250 \GeV$) $p_T^{V}$. Events are further categorised by jet multiplicity, all
jets are required by the selection to have at least two jets, categories are
defined for events with exactly two, or exactly three jets. In the 2-lepton
channel there is a requirement of three or more jets but when referring to all
three channels at once categorisation is referred to as simply 3-jet or 2-jet.

Furthermore events are categorised into a so-called signal region which is
straddled either side by two control regions. This categorisation is achieved
via continuous cuts defined in the $\Delta R(b, \bar{b})$~---~$p_T^{V}$ plane,
they are chosen to maximise the signal purity in the signal region and are shown
for the 1-lepton channel in figure~\ref{fig:drbb-crs}.
\input{06-analysis-strategy/drbb-cuts}
The control regions either side of the signal region are known as the
high-$\Delta R(b, \bar{b})$ and low-$\Delta R(b, \bar{b})$ regions, shortened to
CRHigh and CRLow respectively.

A 3D representation of the regions defined when combining these three
categorisations can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:analysis-categories}.
\input{06-analysis-strategy/analysis-cube}
Note that not all regions of the cube are populated with events in every channel, the medium
$p_T^V$ region is only filled for the 2-lepton channel.

\subsection{Top \texorpdfstring{$e \mu$}{e mu} control region}%
\label{sec:topemucr}

One more region exists only in the 2-lepton channel, it is obtained by inverting the
requirement of two same flavour leptons, requiring two opposite flavour leptons
instead, and keeping all other selection criteria the same. This region contains
almost all $t\bar{t}$ and single top processes (whose Feynman diagrams belong to
the same sum) matching very closely the number of expected events of each of
these backgrounds in the 2-lepton channel. This region is therefore called the
top $e \mu$ control region. The data from this control region can be used as a
prediction for the number of top process events in the 2-lepton channel once
multiplied by a scale factor which accounts for differences in normalisation.
Since data are used as the prediction for these events modelling of shape or
migration between control regions becomes unnecessary.

\section{Composition of Analysis Regions}

This section will detail the composition of each analysis region in terms of
background and signal processes. For all regions the signal process is
$VH~\rightarrow~b\bar{b}$, the prediction for which comes from events generated
using \textsc{Powheg MiNLO}~+~\textsc{Pythia~8} for quark initiated processes
and \textsc{Powheg}~+~\textsc{Pythia~8} for gluon initiated processes as can be
seen in table~\ref{tab:sigMC}.
 
\input{06-analysis-strategy/signal-MC}

The 0-lepton channel contains the  Z+ jets, W + jets, top quark and diboson
backgrounds. The Z + jets background dominates the mixture in the 2-jet category
across signal and control regions. In the 3-jet category the top-quark processes
dominate apart from in the low $\Delta R(b, \bar{b})$ region. There is very
little signal contamination in the control regions. As can be seen in
table~\ref{tab:bkgMC} V + jets events are generated using \textsc{Sherpa~2.2.1},
top quark events are generated using \textsc{Powheg}~+~\textsc{Pythia~8} and
diboson events are generated also using \textsc{Sherpa~2.2.1}, this is true for
these backgrounds across all channels where a Monte-Carlo prediction is used.

\input{06-analysis-strategy/background-MC}

The 1-lepton channel contains the W + jets, Z+ jets, top quark, diboson and multijet
backgrounds where multijet is the name given to backgrounds arising from QCD
processes. The channel is dominated by a mixture of W + jets and top quark
processes, the high $\Delta R(b, \bar{b})$ control region has a higher purity of
top quark processes whereas the low $\Delta R(b, \bar{b})$ control region has a
high purity of W + jets background. Contribution from multijet and Z + jets is
small across all regions, and similarly to in the 0-lepton channel the diboson
background is almost all contained in the signal region.

The 2-lepton channel contains the Z + jets, top quark and diboson backgrounds.
The Z + jets background dominates across all regions particularly in both
$\Delta R(b, \bar{b})$ control regions. Predictions for the top quark processes
are taken from the top $e \mu$ control region described in
section~\ref{sec:topemucr}. Given that these predictions come from data, the
importance of a good understanding of the remaining large background, Z + jets,
is crucial to the performance of the analysis.
