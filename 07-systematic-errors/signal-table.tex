\caption[Summary of $VH$ signal nuisance parameters.]{Summary of the systematic
  uncertainties for SM VH processes: the first column quotes the name of the
  nuisance parameter implemented in the fit referring to a specific systematic
  uncertainty, the second column the source of the uncertainty, the third the
  categories and sample on which it is applied, the fourth column the value of
  the Gaussian prior on the NP (if applicable) and the fifth column the effect
  of the systematic uncertainty. The listed systematic uncertainties are
  separated in branching ratio uncertainty, STXS cross-section QCD scale and PDF
  variations, STXS acceptance effects and shape systematic uncertainties.}
