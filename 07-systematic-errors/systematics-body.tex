\chapter{Systematic Uncertainties}%
\label{ch:systematics}

So far the only errors considered are the random statistical errors on the data
and Monte-Carlo predictions. Systematic errors enter into the analysis in a
large number of places, in this chapter the systematic errors considered in the
analysis are detailed. In general the systematic errors come in one of two
forms, either a shape effect or a normalisation effect. Normalisation effects
alter the number of events in a given sample across the entire sample simply
changing the total number of events. Shape effects change where events lie in a
given distribution causing events to migrate between bins of a histogram, and
potentially across boundaries that are used to define analysis regions described
in~\ref{sec:ana-regions}.

A sub-category of normalisation effect is the acceptance effect which deals with
the normalisation in a particular region or set of regions. The purpose of the
acceptance uncertainties is to account for any mismodelling in the theoretical
prediction of the quantities used to categorise events into regions be it the
leptonic channel, jet multiplicity or an analysis region. Nuisance parameters in
the profile likelihood fit are used to control the acceptance, they are
implemented as Gaussian probability densities whose priors are estimated in
advance. The priors of all of these so called acceptance uncertainties are
calculated using the double ratio
\begin{equation}
  \left. \dfrac{N_{A}^{\text{nominal}}}{N_{B}^{\text{nominal}}} \middle/ \dfrac{N_{A}^{\text{alternative}}}{N_{B}^{\text{alternative}}} \right.,
  \label{eq:acceptance-dr}
\end{equation}
where the formula has been written agnostic of the specific application so
$N_{A}^{nominal}$ is the number of events in the nominal prediction in some
region or category called $A$ and so on.

Another variant of the normalisation effect are the flavour composition
uncertainties. Rather than impacting the normalisation of an entire background
in terms of how they are categorised in the analysis plots, for example in the
plots in section~\ref{sec:prefit}, they impact the sub-processes split by
flavour of the decay products individually. A heavy flavour process is defined as
one where the two leading jets have flavour (b,~b), (b,~c), (b,~l), or (c,~c),
this categorisation is often written as hf for short for example when
considering all heavy flavour sub-process of the V + jets background one could
write V + hf. Flavour composition uncertainties affect the normalisation of one
of the flavour sub-processes with respect to one of the others, specific details
will follow under the sections relating to the relevant backgrounds.

The rest of this chapter will detail the sources of systematic error broken down
into groups of similar origin. Before breaking down each group of systematic
errors a technique called the Boosted Decision Tree Re-weighting method will be
explained as it used across a number of the different groups. The author's
contributions include the determination of all of the Z + jets systematic
errors, determination of systematic errors relating to the flavour composition
of simulated top process events, and development and testing of the Boosted
Decision Tree Re-weighting method.

\section{Parametrising Variance Due To Shape Uncertainties}
\label{sec:re-weighting}

The predictions entering into the profile-likelihood fit of the analysis can be
written as a probability density $p(\vec{x}|\vec{\theta})$, where $\vec{x} =
[x_{1},..., x_{i}]$ is a vector of observable quantities, with $N$ elements and
$\vec{\theta}$ represents the theoretical parameters of the model. The
parameters may come from the Standard Model theory or phenomenological
considerations that must be taken into account to turn that theory into a usable
prediction.

As described above, shape effects may impact the prediction of a given
Monte-Carlo generator that has a particular set of parameters. The choice of
generator will change the prediction due to different choices made by the
generator creators, including but not limited to, the parton shower model,
hadronisation model and non-perturbative processes. One way to get a handle on
the variance of a particular generator is therefore to literally vary these
choices by picking an alternative generator and drawing a comparison to the
alternative prediction. This method is flawed in ways which will be discussed
but is nonetheless fairly common and often one of the few choices available to
analysers when they are trying to get an idea of what the systematic errors on
the modelling of complex physics processes are. Two such methods of comparison
will be detailed here as they are used in this analysis, they the single
dimension parameterisation described in section~\ref{sec:1D-reweight} and a
multi-dimensional parameterisation described in section~\ref{sec:ND-reweight}.
Following this a hybrid approach which uses both methods will be described in
section~\ref{sec:hybrid-reweight}. These methods are described here in general
and then the specific implementations are discussed later under sections
relevant to the systematic errors they are used to calculate.

\subsection{Single Dimension Parameterisation}
\label{sec:1D-reweight}

The single dimension parameterisation uses the ratio of probability densities
\begin{equation}
  r(\vec{x}) = \frac{p(\vec{x}|\vec{\theta}_{1})}{p(\vec{x}|\vec{\theta}_{0})},
  \label{eq:DensityRatio}
\end{equation}
where the subscripts on $\vec{\theta}$ number different choices of the
parameters which govern the model, for example due to different choice of
generator. Here the subscript 0 denotes the nominal prediction and 1 denotes an
alternative. In order to map the nominal to the alternative it is clear that the
one can multiply $p(\vec{x}|\vec{\theta}_{0})$ by the ratio.

The only way that this calculation is tractable is to consider a single
dimension of the probability density function, specifically a single observable
chosen from the vector $\vec{x}$. The ratio then becomes
\begin{equation}
  r(x_{i}) = \frac{p(x_{i}|\vec{\theta}_{1})}{p(x_{i}|\vec{\theta}_{0})},
  \label{eq:1D-ratio}
\end{equation}
which can in turn be calculated for as many or as few as the elements of
$\vec{x}$ as is desired. It should be noted that when the ratio is calculated
using only a single variable it can still be used to map the $N$ dimensional
nominal prediction to the alternative, however the mapping is only guaranteed to
be successful in the dimension chosen to calculate the ratio and in general
agreement between the two predictions in the other variables can not be relied
upon.

Figure~\ref{fig:IllustKinUncert} shows a graphical illustration of how this
single dimensional ratio is calculated. In practice the ratio is used to derive
a systematic shape uncertainty by weighting each event in the nominal
prediction as a function of the variable $x_{i}$ whose distribution was used to
calculate the ratio. Limitations on the sample size of each prediction mean that
in practice it is better to smooth the ratio via the use of a parametric fit in
order to mitigate any large statistical fluctuations in a single bin of the
ratio (arising from a large fluctuation in one of the predictions in that bin).
In figure~\ref{fig:IllustKinUncert} the parametric fit is represented by the
solid line in the ratio.

\subsection{$N$-dimensional Parametrisation}
\label{sec:ND-reweight}

As already alluded to in the previous section there are issues with the
parametrisation in a single dimension. Not only is the mapping only guaranteed
to work in a single dimension but if the technique is applied sequentially on
one variable after another the mapping from the first step can be undone by the
second. That is to say that if one calculates the ratio~\ref{eq:1D-ratio} with
$i=1$ and $i=2$ the re-weighting by $r(x_2)$ will not preserve the agreement
between the two predictions that would be achieved by the re-weighting with
$r(x_1)$. It is clear that this is because a ratio for a given $x_i$ only encode
information relating to the PDFs $p(x_i|\theta_0)$ and $p(x_i|\theta_1)$ whereas
what is wanted is something that encodes the multi-variate distributions
$p(\vec{x}|\theta_0)$ and $p(\vec{x}|\theta_1)$.

A function capable of providing compression of the full multi-variate
distribution has already been discussed, these are the functions that one
obtains when training a machine learning algorithm such as those mentioned
in chapter~\ref{ch:ml}. Functions of the form given in
equation~\ref{eq:ml-general} can encode information from the multi-variate
input $\vec{x}$ into a lower dimensional $\vec{y}$ that captures the
correlations between the different elements of the inputs $\vec{x}$.
Specifically for this parametrisation the model is trained to classify events as
coming from either the Monte-Carlo generator with parameters $\theta_0$ or
$\theta_1$, the output is therefore written as $\vec{y} = [y_0, y_1]$ where each
term in the vector represents the probability that an event comes from
$p(\vec{x} | \theta_0)$ or $p(\vec{x} | \theta_1)$ respectively. Note that the
choice of output function in the model ensure that probability is conserved,
i.e. $y_0 + y_1 = 1$. This technique has been demonstrated in the
literature~\cite{cranmer2016approximating} where the mathematical details are
discussed in more detail.

Our setup allows to create the following approximation
\begin{equation}
  r(\vec{x}) =  \frac{p(\vec{x}|\vec{\theta}_{1})}{p(\vec{x}|\vec{\theta}_{0})}
  \approx \frac{F(\vec{x}, \vec{w})[1]}{F(\vec{x}, \vec{w})[0]},
  \label{eq:bdtr-approximation}
\end{equation}
where $F$ is our trained model whose hyper-parameters we can considered fixed
and drop from the notation (previously denoted $\vec{\theta}$ in
chapter~\ref{ch:ml}). The numbers in the square brackets indicate which element
of the $\vec{y}$ is being selected. Once the above approximation is made the
steps to generate weights and perform a parameterisation of the difference in
shape between two predictions is the same as in the one dimensional case. By
placing certain restrictions on $F$ one can turn the approximation into an
equivalence, this is discussed in~\cite{modelling-note}, however for what is
considered here the approximation will be the focus.
Figure~\ref{fig:nd-rw-illustration} shows an illustration of the $N$-dimensional
parametrisation procedure.

%\subsection{Hybrid $p-n$ dimensional parameterisation}
%\label{sec:hybrid-reweight}

% The following hybrid approach utilises both the above ICHEP 1-dimensional and
% BDTr $p$-dimensional parameterisation techniques. Specifically, prior to
% training a classifier ($s(\vec{x})$) on two MC predictions
% ($\vec{\theta}_{0}$ and $\vec{\theta}_{1}$), the input space of the nominal
% generator is weighted by the density ratio of a subset of the dimensions of the
% input space, $\mathbb{R}^{n} \subset \mathbb{R}^{p}$. In the simplest case, and
% that used within this analysis, $n=1$ and is specifically the $p^{V}_{T}$ or
% $E^{miss}_{T}$ of the event. In this situation the density ratio becomes:

% \begin{equation}
%   r(\vec{x}) = \frac{p(\vec{x} \rightarrow p^{V}_{T}|\vec{\theta}_{1})}{p(\vec{x} \rightarrow p^{V}_{T}|\vec{\theta}_{0})},
%   \label{eq:pTVDensityRatio}
% \end{equation}
% which is used to map the nominal MC prediction ($\vec{\theta}_{0}$) to look like
% the alternative generator ($\vec{\theta}_{1}$). This is demonstrated in the
% Figure \ref{fig:IllustKinUncert_nDim-n} (a) and \ref{fig:IllustKinUncert_nDim-n}
% (b), where (a) shows a toy example of the density ratio $r(\mathcal{O}_{1} |
% \vec{\theta}_{0}, \vec{\theta}_{1})$, which is then used to re-weight the
% nominal input space as shown by sub-figure (b). Following this the $p^{V}_{T}$
% re-weighted input space of the nominal generator, and the unaltered alternative
% generator are used to train a classifier $s'(\vec{x})$. Upon completion
% this new $p-1$ dimensional classifier is used to derive a density ratio,
% $r(s'(\vec{x}))$, that encodes all remaining information that separates
% the two generators (excluding the $p^{V}_{T}$ dependnce).
% \begin{figure}[t]
%   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{BDTr_Theory/IllustrationOfProbDensityEstimators_pDim-n.pdf}
%   \caption{Illustration of hybrid $p=3-1$-dimensional density ratio estimation
%     for $<bm{x} = [\mathcal{O}_{1}, \mathcal{O}_{2}, \mathcal{O}_{3}]$
%     input space when comparing two MC predictions. Sub-figure a) shows the
%     $\mathcal{O}_{1}$ dimension of the MC prediction, and the corresponding
%     density ratio. Sub-figure b) then shows the resulting 3-dimensional input
%     space after re-weighting by the $\mathcal{O}_{1}$ density ratio given in a).
%     Sub-fgiure c) then shows the resulting new classifier $s(\vec{x})$
%     for this \textit{1D weighted} input space. The red shaded and dotted
%     distribution in sub-figure c) matches that of figure c) in Figure
%     \ref{fig:IllustKinUncert_nDim}, simply to demonstrate how the MVa response
%     of the newly trained MVA differs.}
%   \label{fig:IllustKinUncert_nDim-n}
% \end{figure}

% The reader will find this technique referred to in the text as the
% \textit{$p^{V}_{T}$ factorised BDTr} approach, specifically within the $W+$jets
% and $t\bar{t}$ sections, due to the fact that the $p^{V}_{T}$ distribution is
% factorised away prior to the BDT training.

% For the BDTr technique the following procedure is implemented:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item \textbf{Kinematic Observerable Evaluation:} Project MC model phase space
%   onto the $\mathcal{O}_{i}$ dimension for both the nominal, $\theta_{0}$, and
%   alternative, $\theta_{1}$, models. Typically $\mathcal{O}_{i} =
%   p^{V}_{T}/E^{\textrm{miss}}_{T}$
% \item \textbf{Density Ratio Eval.:} Obtain binned or analytical estimate of
%   density ratio $r(\mathcal{O}_{i})$
% \item \textbf{Re-weight:} Re-weight the nominal MC model probability density
%   function $p(\mathcal{O}_{i}| \vec{\theta}_{0})$ via the density ratio
%   $r(\mathcal{O}_{i})$ as a function of $\mathcal{O}_{i}$
% \item \textbf{Train:} Train a BDT classifier to separate the re-weighted nominal
%   MC model, $\vec{\theta'}_{0}$, from the alternative MC model,
%   $\vec{\theta}_{1}$.
% \item \textbf{Evaluate:} Evaluate the classifier response for the two MC models,
%   $s'(\vec{x}; \vec{\theta'}_{0}, \vec{\theta}_{1})$
% \item \textbf{Density Ratio Eval.:} Obtain binned or analytic estimate of
%   density ratio $r(u=s'(\vec{x}))$
% \item \textbf{Re-weight:} Re-weight the nominal MC model probability density
%   function $p(s'(\vec{x})| \vec{\theta}_{0})$ via the density function
%   $r(u=s'(\vec{x}))$ as a function of $s'(\vec{x})$. Separately
%   re-weight the nominal $p(\mathcal{O}_{i}| \vec{\theta}_{0})$ via the
%   1-dimension density ratio $r(\mathcal{O}_{i})$. The former is the BDTr
%   nuisance parameter, and the later is the $p^{V}_{T}/E^{\textrm{miss}}_{T}$
%   nuisance parameter.
% \end{enumerate}


% \subsection{ BDTr -vs- Hybrid BDTr: Motivation}
% The adoption of the hybrid approach stems from the nature of the 2-point
% MC-to-MC comparison. Two MC models, whilst seeded by the same Standard Model,
% are determined by a collection of parameters, $\vec{\theta}_{j}$, that are not
% always equivalent. For example one collection may contain parameters that are
% not shared by its counter-part, i.e. some parameters have no one-to-one
% correspondence amongst the two models. Furthermore, the remaining parameters
% that are common, like the renormalisation scale, may not share the same value.
% This means that the MC-to-MC comparison does not systematically change in a
% controlled fashion the underlying parameters that govern the probability density
% function, $p(\vec{x} | \vec{\theta}_{j})$. In essence it is not
% guarranteed that one can smoothly interpolate between the two models.

% In a profile likelihood fit this means that interpolating between the two MC
% predictions in a smooth and continous manner via a gaussian constrained nuisance
% parameter has very little meaning. Furthermore, it is possible that one MC model
% may match data in one region of phase space, whilst its counter-part may better
% model a distinctly separate and unique region of phase space. Therefore, the
% constraints and pulls imposed by the data in one region do not trivially
% transfer to the other phase space regions of an analysis.

% Further considerations must also be made concerning what the analysis is
% sensitive to. Specifially, Figure \ref{fig:1lepFitRegions} shows the analysis
% $p^{V}_{T} = \{ \left[150 \textrm{\GeV},250 \textrm{\GeV}\right], \left[250
%   \textrm{\GeV}\right[ \}$ and $\{\textrm{CRLow, SR, CRHigh}\}$ fit regions, in
% addition to the corresponding fit discriminant distributions used in each case.
% As is shown, the SR regions use an MVA distribution as the fit discriminant,
% whilst the control regions use a single $p^{V}_{T}$ bin. Considering that two
% $p^{V}_{T}$ fit regions are defined within the analysis fit model, a two binned
% $p^{V}_T{} \geq 150$\GeV differential cross-section is therefore utilised.

% Considering these two fundametal concepts, it was decided to factorise the
% $p^{V}_{T}$ uncertainty of each physics process, and allow the BDTr technique to
% encode all differences in the remaining variables of the analysis MVA. This was
% further supported by a known $t\bar{t}$ mismodelling of the data when using
% Powheg+Pythia8 for high $p^{V}_{T}$ events; Powheg+Pythia8 generates a harder
% $p^{V}_{T}$ spectrum than data. In essence, fitting directly the $p^{V}_{T}$
% spectrum, combined with the known miss-modelling lead to the need for an
% additional degree of freedom with regards to the $p^{V}_{T}$ kinematics.

% \subsubsection{BDTr-based shape uncertainties}
% \label{subsubsec:WjetsBDTrBasedShapeSyst}

% A hybrid BDTr approach, as described in Section~\ref{subsec:ShapeMethod}, has
% been adopted in the 1-lepton and the 0-lepton channels to derive the BDTr-based
% shape systematics.

% \textbf{$p_T^V$\ shape systematic}

% In each leptonic channel, eight shapes are derived depending on the jet category
% (2-jet and 3-jet) and flavour composition of the event. Only heavy flavours
% events ($W$+bb, $W$+bc, $W$+bl and $W$+cc) are considered as the $W$+l and
% $W$+cl background processes compose less than 1\% of the background in any
% region.

% In the 1-lepton channel, these shapes are obtained from a linear fit to the
% ratio between \textsc{Sherpa}~2.2.1 and \textsc{MadGraph}  in the $p_T^V$ distribution with $p_T^V
% > 75$ \GeV. In the 0-lepton channel, the MET distribution with MET $>150$ \GeV
% is used.

% Figure~\ref{fig:wjets_1lep_2jet_SysWPtVBDTr} and
% Figure~\ref{fig:wjets_1lep_3jet_SysWPtVBDTr} shows $p_T^V$ shape systematics in
% the 1-lepton channel for each heavy flavour category and for 2-jet and 3-jet
% events, respectively.

% Given the low statistics in the 0-lepton channel, the $p_T^V$ shapes derived in

% approach is showed in Figure~\ref{fig:wjets_01lep_2jet_SysWPtVBDTr} for the
% 2tag2jet category and in Figure~\ref{fig:wjets_01lep_3jet_SysWPtVBDTr} for the
% 2tag3jet region for each heavy flavour pair. An offset between the $p_T^V$ and the
% MET shapes in the two channels can be seen, especially in the $W$+bl events.
% This is due to the fact that the $p_T^V$ shape is derived from a unit-normalized
% ratio between \textsc{Sherpa}~2.2.1 and \textsc{MadGraph} in the $p_T^V > 75$ \GeV  range, while
% the MET distribution is normalized to 1 in the MET $>150$ \GeV range. This is
% confirmed by the example plot in

% and the MET shape in the 2tag2jet region have been normalized to 1 in the

\section{Experimental Systematic Uncertainties}

This section describes experimental systematic uncertainties, these arise due to
limitations of the hardware discussed in chapter~\ref{ch:detector} and
reconstruction algorithms described in chapter~\ref{ch:recon}. All of these
uncertainties are provided by different combined performance (CP) groups and
made centrally available to members of the ATLAS collaboration, this ensures a
consistent understanding of the performance of the detector and centrally
provided reconstruction algorithms in Athena. A summary of all of the
experimental systematic uncertainties used in the analysis can be found in
table~\ref{tab::expSyst}.
\input{07-systematic-errors/experimental-table.tex}

\subsection{Luminosity and Pile-up}
\label{sec:lumisys}

As discussed in chapter~\ref{ch:detector} luminosity is used to measure how much
data is recorded by the detector in any span of time. The uncertainty is
calculated for each year of running and is determined to be  2.1\%, 2.6\%,
2.4\%, and 2.0\% for the years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 respectively. A combined
uncertainty is calculated for the entire period 2015--2018 at 1.7\%. The
methodology used to calculate this figure is similar to that detailed
in~\cite{lumiDetermine}, from calibrations of the luminosity scale using x--y
beam-separation scans~\cite{lumiTwiki}.

Pile-up uncertainties are computed by changing the nominal data scale of
$1.0/1.03$ to $1.0/1.00$ and $1.0/1.18$ to get the up and down variations
respectively~\cite{puTWiki}.

\subsection{Triggers}
\label{sec:trigsys}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{$E_T^{\text{miss}}$}{MET} Triggers}

Scale factors are derived for the $E_T^{\text{miss}}$ triggers using
$W(\mu,\nu)$ + jets events as outlined in~\cite{VHObjectNote2019}.

Three uncertainties are taken into account, the statistical error on the dataset
used to derived the scale factor \texttt{METTrigStat}, a parameter used to
account for the choice of physics process and the effect that might have on the
determination of the scale factor \texttt{METTrigTop} and \texttt{METTrigSumPt}
which aims to account for dependence of the offline $S_T$ (as defined
in~\ref{sec:0lep-selection}) on the trigger efficiency. The uncertainty
\texttt{METTrigTop} is named as such because it is derived from a comparison of
the scale factors as calculated with a $t\bar{t}$ sample and compared to the
nominal sample. The uncertainty relating to $S_T$ is only applied to events
recorded in 2017 due to a specific trigger used in this year.

\subsubsection{Lepton trigger}

The CP group recommendations for the lepton triggers can be found
in~\cite{VHObjectNote2019}. The group provide a tool for determining the lepton
trigger systematic error which is implemented in the CxAOD Framework (mentioned
in section~\ref{sec:cxaod}). The nuisance parameter
\texttt{EL\_EFF\_Trigger\_TotalCorrUncertainty} is used to control the overall
uncertainty on the electron trigger. For the muons, the tool returns two components
\texttt{MUON\_EFF\_TrigSystUncertainty} and \texttt{MUON\_EFF\_TrigStatUncertainty}
which account for the systematic error and the statistical error on scale factor
respectively. An up and down variation of 1-$\sigma$ are used for all of the
aforementioned nuisance parameters.

\subsection{Electrons}

% \subsubsection{Electron efficiency systematic}

% Reconstruction and identification (ID) efficiency and its systematic
% uncertainties are provided by the CP group as
% \texttt{ElectronEfficiencyCorrection}~\cite{electronTWiki}.

% The electron efficiency scale factors have been calculated using the full Run
% 2 data.

% The reconstruction efficiency is 97-99\% in the entire \pt~range. The ID
% efficiency scale factor is available from $\pt>7$~GeV. The scale factor of the
% combined cuts of impact parameter significance and on $|z_{0}\sin\theta|$ is
% included in ID efficiency scale factor. The isolation efficiency scale factor
% is also provided. In current recommendation scale factors for $\pt>150$ GeV
% are unity due to lack of statistics to measure scale factor. Therefore a
% systematic uncertainty of additional $\pm 2\%$ is assigned above 150 GeV.
% Three independent systematic sources
% (\texttt{EL\_EFF\_ID\_TotalCorreUncertainty},
% \texttt{EL\_EFF\_Reco\_TotalCorrUncertainty},
% \texttt{EL\_EFF\_Iso\_TotalCorrUncertainty}) are considered as electron
% efficiency systematic uncertainties.

% \subsubsection{Electron energy scale and resolution}

% Energy scale and resolution systematic uncertainties have been provided by CP
% group~\cite{EgammaCalibTWiki}. More than 60 systematic variation are
% considered in the energy calibration. However, the electron energy scale and
% resolution systematic uncertainties are not dominant systematic sources. This
% analysis is very weekly sensitive to the energy scale and resolution.
% Therefore, we used simple a systematic model. Two systematic uncertainties
% (\texttt{EG\_RESOLUTION\_ALL}, \texttt{EG\_SCALE\_ALL}) are considered in this
% analysis.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Muons}
\label{sec:muonsys}
% %------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsubsection{Muon efficiency systematic uncertainties}

% Reconstruction, isolation and track-to-vertex association ($d_0$ significance
% and $z_0\sin\theta$) scale factors are calculated using $Z\rightarrow \mu\mu$
% and $J/\psi\rightarrow \mu\mu$ events in the full data of 2015, which
% corresponds to 3.2 fb$^{-1}$
% (\texttt{MuonEfficiencyCorrections-03-02-05})~\cite{muonTWiki}. The scale
% factor is valid in the full \pt range. Since $J/\psi$ measurement is valid
% below 15 GeV and $Z$ measurement is more accurate above 15 GeV, the separated
% systeamatic uncertainties are used in low-\pt (below 15 GeV). Four independent
% systematic uncertainties (\texttt{MUON\_EFF\_RECO\_STAT},
% \texttt{MUON\_EFF\_RECO\_STAT\_LOWPT}, \texttt{MUON\_EFF\_RECO\_SYS},
% \texttt{MUON\_EFF\_RECO\_SYS\_LOWPT}) are provided. The isolation scale factor
% and its systematic uncertainties (\texttt{MUON\_EFF\_ISO\_STAT},
% \texttt{MUON\_EFF\_ISO\_SYS}) are supported in the range of $10 < \pt < 500$
% GeV. For muons out of this range, the scale factor is 1$\pm$0.05. The scale
% factor of the combined cuts on the Impact parameter significance and the
% $|z_0\sin\theta|$ is also provided from above MuonEfficiencyCorrections
% version. Two kinds of independent systematic uncertainties
% (\texttt{MUON\_EFF\_TTVA\_STAT}, \texttt{MUON\_EFF\_TTVA\_SYS}) are provided.
% Systematic uncertainties are evaluated from $\pm 1\sigma$ variations. %In
% using muons close to jets ($\Delta R_{\mu-\text{jet}} < 0.4$), an extra
% systematic uncertainty is added on top of nominal uncertainty.

% \subsubsection{Muon momentum scale and resolution}

% Muon momentum scale and resolution correction and uncertainties are provided
% by the CP group \\
% (\texttt{MuonMomentumCorrections-01-00-29})~\cite{muonTWiki}. Muons have been
% calibrated with $Z\rightarrow \mu\mu$ for the high $p_{T}$ region ($\pt > 20$
% GeV) and with $J/\psi\rightarrow \mu\mu$ for the low \pt~ region ($\pt < 20$
% GeV). Three kinds of systematic sources (\texttt{MUONS\_ID},
% \texttt{MUONS\_MS}, \texttt{MUONS\_SCALE}) related to scale and resolution are
% provided. These systematic uncertainties are evaluated by varying the scale
% and the ID/MS track $\pm 1\sigma$.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Jets}
\label{sec:jetssys}
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% Jet systematics are implemented through the \texttt{JetUncertaintiesTool} using the
% usual PAT interface for systematic variations. The number of uncertainties is
% divided into different reduction categories. An analysis may choose between the
% full set of nuisance parameters (\textasciitilde50 baseline parameters) or a
% globally reduced set of 23 parameters. The baseline set uses \emph{in-situ}
% analyses, eta intercalibration, high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ jets, pile-up, flavour
% composition, flavour response, $b$-jets, and punch-through jets. Each of these
% areas of concern may be accessed separately using the tool. The reduced sets
% comprise nuisance parameters made from performing a principal component
% analysis and combining the resulting variations in such a way as to preserve
% correlations in certain jet-kinematic regions. If an analysis will later
% combine their result with another group, these reduced sets may not be

% used. We use the 23-parameter reduced set.

% The most prominent sources of jet-related uncertainty are the uncertainties from
% the jet energy scale (JES) and jet energy resolution (JER). The determination of
% the JES is documented in \cite{JetCalibration2015} and the JER is determined
% from data-MC comparisons. Both uncertainties are available through the
% \texttt{JetUncertaintiesTool}. 

\subsection{$E_T^{\text{miss}}$}
\label{sec:metsys}
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \MET systematics are implemented through the \texttt{METSystematicsTool} using
% the usual
% PAT interface. This tool can be configured to account for calorimeter-based
% jets and track-based jets. The uncertainties related to TST are concerned with
% MC-to-data disagreements, and thus are not needed when using data. The list of
% uncertainties associated with \MET in this analysis are
% \texttt{MET\_SoftTrk\_ResoPara}, \texttt{MET\_SoftTrk\_ResoPerp},
% \texttt{MET\_SoftTrk\_ScaleDown}, \texttt{MET\_SoftTrk\_ScaleUp},
% \texttt{MET\_JetTrk\_ScaleDown }, and \texttt{MET\_JetTrk\_ScaleUp}.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Flavour Tagging}
\label{sec:bjetsys}
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The uncertainties related to $b$-tagging jets are implemented as event-weight
% systematics (scale factors). These scale factors (SF) are calculated in the
% following ways:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item For each signal jet identify if it has been $b$-tagged or not. If it has,
%   multiply the event weight by the SF retrieved from the
%   \texttt{BTaggingEfficiencyTool}
%   CP tool. Otherwise, multiply the event weight by the inefficiency SF (InSF)
%   retrieved from the same tool. This will yield the ``Nominal'' event weight.
% \item For each systematic, vary the SF and InSF by the systematic using the
%   \texttt{BTaggingEfficiencyTool} and repeat step 1 and store the event weight
%   for this
%   systematic.
% \item For all histograms, make a separate histogram for each weight systematic
%   using the corresponding weight.
% \end{enumerate}
% The individual systematics for $b$-tagging are on the order of about 40
% elements per flavour ($b$, $c$, $\tau$, and light). In an effort to alleviate
% the burden of accounting for \textasciitilde160 systematics variations the
% flavour tagging CP group has performed a principal component analysis to
% reduce the number of systematic variations. This reduction is summarized in
% Table~\ref{BTaggingEV} for the chosen medium (70\%) operating point .

% \begin{table}
%   \centering
%   \begin{tabular}{l c c c}
%     \hline
%     \hline
%     \multirow{2}{*}{Reduction Scheme} & \multicolumn{3}{ c }{Number of variations:} \\
%     & $b$-jet & $c$-jet & light-jet \\
%     \hline
%     Medium & 3 & 3 & 5 \\
%     \hline
%     \hline
%   \end{tabular}
%   \caption[Table caption text]{Flavor tagging reduction schemes. Fewer
%     variations yield a less accurate preservation of total error and
%   correlations. $\tau$-jet variations are identical to $c$-jet variations with
% an additional systematic for the $c$-to-$\tau$ extrapolation.}
%   \label{BTaggingEV}
% \end{table}

% \ \\Each analysis must determine the appropriate reduction scheme based on the
% observed effects on the final distributions. There are two additionally
% systematics that are not part of the reduction scheme and must be treated
% separately. These are uncertainties related to the $p_{\mathrm{T}}$
% extrapolation~\cite{BTaggingExtrap2015} and charm-to-bottom quark
% extrapolation. A list of the ``Medium'' systematics include:
% \texttt{FT\_EFF\_Eigen\_Light0}, \texttt{FT\_EFF\_Eigen\_Light1},
% \texttt{FT\_EFF\_Eigen\_Light2}, \texttt{FT\_EFF\_Eigen\_Light3},
% \texttt{FT\_EFF\_Eigen\_Light4}, \texttt{FT\_EFF\_Eigen\_B0},
% \texttt{FT\_EFF\_Eigen\_B1}, \texttt{FT\_EFF\_Eigen\_B2},
% \texttt{FT\_EFF\_Eigen\_C0}, \texttt{FT\_EFF\_Eigen\_C1},
% \texttt{FT\_EFF\_Eigen\_C2}, 
% \texttt{FT\_EFF\_Eigen\_extrapolation}, \\and
% \texttt{FT\_EFF\_Eigen\_extrapolation\_from\_charm}.

\section{V + jets Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{sec:vjets}
Whilst the physics of the W and Z + jets processes leads to them being in
different channels and needing to be treated differently in the analysis, the
underlying theory means that simulation of these processes is coupled,
particularly as they are simulated with the same software.

The V + jets processes are simulated with
\textsc{Sherpa}~2.2.1~\cite{1126-6708-2009-02-007} as mentioned in
section~\ref{sec:composition}, which is interfaced with the
NNPDFs~\cite{Ball:2012cx} for both the matrix element calculation and the parton shower
tuning. Events with many additional jets produced in association with the vector
boson largely contribute to the background in this analysis, therefore a feature
of \textsc{Sherpa}~2.2.1 is used in which it provides a combination of matrix
elements with different parton multiplicities. Up to 2 extra partons are
included in the next-to-leading order matrix element, and 3 or 4 extra partons
are included at leading order in QCD. In order to combine different patron
multiplicities a matching scheme based on the CKKW-L~\cite{Lonnblad:2001iq,
  Lavesson:2005xu} merging technique is used, with a merging scale of $Q_{cut} =
20$~\GeV. Simulation of events with more than 4 extra partons relies on the
parton shower algorithm of \textsc{Sherpa}. The parton shower and underlying
events models are included in \textsc{Sherpa} whose generator adopts a full
5--flavour scheme with b- and c-quarks being treated as massless in the matrix
element, in the version used. Massive quarks can be produced in the parton
shower and heavy flavours (quarks as heavy or heavier than a c-quark) can be
produced directly in the scattering process of the underlying event.

The analysis gains a lot of sensitivity from high $p_T^V$ regions of phase
space, and also has the requirement of two b-tagged jets in the event selection
as mentioned in section~\ref{sec:selection}. It is therefore important to ensure
that a large statistical sample in these regions is available such that
fluctuations are smaller than those that would be found in the data. In order to
achieve this two methods are used, firstly samples are simulated in specific
slices of the larger of the $p_T$ of the vector boson or the $H_T$ of the event.
Events are simulated in the following slices
\begin{equation}
  \text{max}(p_T^V, H_T) = [0\text{--}70, 70\text{--}140, 140\text{--}280, 280\text{--}500, 500\text{--}1000, >1000]~\GeV.
\end{equation}
The dedicated slices at high $\text{max}(p_T^V, H_T)$ ensure a large number of
events are simulated in the high $p_T^V$ region of phase space. Secondly filters
are applied on the flavour of the jets that produced in association with the
vector boson.  The filters used for these samples are shown in
table~\ref{tab:bc-filters}.
\input{07-systematic-errors/bc-filters}
The filters are not applied to the highest slices in $\text{max}(p_T^V, H_T)$.
The filtering strategy for $Z\nu\nu$ samples differs in the mc16e campaign using
a combination of $p_T^Z$ and $m_{jj}$ to better populate the region above the
MET trigger thresholds, and VBF phase spaces with high $m_{jj}$. These samples
also use a tighter b-filter compared to their mc16a/d counterpart which is also
described in table~\ref{tab:bc-filters}. All nominal V + jets samples with the
corresponding max($H_T$,$p_T^V$) slices and flavour filters are listed in
tables~\ref{tabular:mc_samples_Wjets} \ref{tabular:mc_samples_Zlljets}, and
\ref{tabular:mc_samples_Zvvjets} in the appendices.
+
A set of alternative predictions are used for a number of purposes in the
analysis, one such purpose is to investigate any discrepancies that may arise
between data and the nominal prediction. If the same discrepancy is present when
comparing he alternative prediction to data then the discrepancy may arise from
experimental error rather than weaknesses in the modelling. One kind of
modelling uncertainty also relies on the comparison of two predictions, for
example the nominal versus the alternative.

The alternative samples are generated using
\textsc{MadGraph}~5~\cite{MADGRAPH5_aMC@NLO} interfaced to \textsc{Pythia}~8 for
the modelling of the parton shower and the underlying event. The
\textsc{MadGraph}~5 v2 generator provides a LO (QCD) description of these
processes, merging together matrix-element calculations with different parton
multiplicities, up to 4 additional jets, higher jet multiplicities are modelled
by the parton shower algorithm. The merging scheme applied to combine different
parton multiplicities is the same as for the nominal samples, the CKKW-L scheme,
but has a merging scale of $Q_{cut} = 30$~\GeV. For the LO ME calculation the
NNPDF2.3 LO PDFs are used, with $\alpha_S = 1.3$.  Similarly to
\textsc{Sherpa}~2.2.1, also \textsc{MadGraph}~adopts a full 5-flavour scheme
with massless quarks in the ME calculation, while massive quarks can be produced
by the parton shower. All alternative V + jets samples are listed in
tables~\ref{tabular:zjetsAlternativeSamples} and
\ref{tabular:wjetsAlternativeSamples} in the appendices.

As well as using an alternative Monte-Carlo generator the nominal generator,
\textsc{Sherpa}, includes systematic variations internally. Every
\textsc{Sherpa}~2.2.1 V + jets sample has an event weight corresponding to each
of the variations detailed in table~\ref{tab:sherpa-variations}\footnote{Some of
the variations cannot be produced by \textsc{Sherpa}~2.2.1 and so
\textsc{Sherpa}~2.1 is used instead. For these variations half of the variation
in each direction is taken as the uncertainty rather than comparing to the
central value of the \textsc{Sherpa}~2.2.1 prediction.}.
\input{07-systematic-errors/vjets-sherpa-vars.tex}

\subsubsection{V + jets Cross Section}
The V + jets cross sections are known at NNLO (QCD)~\cite{Butterworth:1287902},
the higher order cross sections are used to normalise the V+jets samples in the
analysis. For the W + jets samples the total cross section from \textsc{Sherpa} or
from \textsc{MadGraph}, averaged across all 3 lepton flavours taking into account the
different hadron filter efficiencies, is scaled to the NNLO prediction obtaining
scaling factor of $k_{\text{NNLO}}^{\text{QCD}} = 0.9702$.

For Z + jets some subtleties must be considered. For $Z \to \ell\ell$ + jets the
cut at generator level, $m_{\ell\ell}>40$ \GeV, must be taken into account. The
NNLO calculation uses a cut of $66<m_{\ell\ell}<116$ \GeV, which can be applied
at truth level to the samples of this analysis in order to get the scaling
correct as follows:
\begin{equation}
  k_{\text{NNLO}}^{\text{QCD}} = \frac{\sigma_{\text{NNLO}}(66<m_{\ell\ell}<116\,{\GeV})}{\sigma_{\textsc{Sherpa},\textsc{MadGraph}}(66<m_{\ell\ell}<116\,{\GeV})},
  \label{eq:nnlo-vjets-k}
\end{equation}
hence the scaling factor is found to be $0.9751$. For $Z \to \nu\nu$ +jets the
NNLO no theoretical cross section is available. Values from the
Particle Data Group (PDG)~\cite{PDG} are used to correct for the difference
between the BR($Z \to \nu\nu$) and BR($Z \to \ell\ell$), and the NNLO cross
section is used without any mass cuts and with the $Z/\gamma^*$ interference
removed. The scaling factor is therefore calculated to be $0.9728$. It is not
necessarily expected that the scaling factors should be different for $Z \to
\ell \ell$ and $Z \to \nu \nu$ events but this can be explained as both
\textsc{Sherpa} and \textsc{MadGraph} used different branching ratios for these
two processes in their generators compared with those used by the higher order
theoretical calculations.

\subsection{W + jets Modelling Uncertainties}
A number of nuisance parameters are introduced to account for modelling
uncertainties on the W + jets background process. These uncertainties are
considered and derived in the 0-- and 1-- lepton channels only as the amount of
W + jets background present in the 2--lepton channel is negligible. A summary of
all of the uncertainties for this background can be found in
table~\ref{tab:wjets_systematics}.

The nominal and alternative predictions described in~\ref{sec:vjets} are used to
in the determination of all of the values described in the following. 

\subsubsection{Normalisation and Acceptance Uncertainties}

A summary of the normalisation uncertainties is shown in
table~\ref{tab:wjetsnorm}.
\input{07-systematic-errors/wjets-norm-table}
A single nuisance parameter is introduced for each of the W + cl and W + l
processes which are both heavily suppressed by the analysis requirement of two
b-tagged jets. There is a large mismodelling of the normalisation of the W + hf
process and so floating normalisations are used separately in the 2--jet and
3--jet categories. Priors for several acceptance uncertainties are calculated using
equation~\ref{eq:acceptance-dr}\footnote{Whilst the priors are obtained with the
  double ratio formula involving two regions, the effect of the uncertainty is
  applied to only one of the two regions. This does not affect the result but
  only the interpretation of the resulting acceptance factor.} which are used to
control the migration of events between the 0-- and 1--lepton channels and the
migration between the $\Delta R(b, \bar{b})$ regions.

The parameter controlling migration between the two leptonic channels
\texttt{SysWbbNorm\_L0} is applied to both the 2--jet and 3--jet regions of the
0--lepton channel. The choice to apply to the 0--lepton channel and not the
1--lepton channel is made because the 1--lepton channel provides a better
constraint on the W + hf process. Whilst all alternative predictions are
considered the size of this prior is dominated by the difference between the
nominal prediction and \textsc{MadGraph}.

Migration between the $\Delta R(b, \bar{b})$ control regions and the signal
region is controlled by one parameter per control region. Named
\texttt{SysWbbCRSRextrap} it can be seen in table~\ref{tab:wjetsnorm} that it is
applied in each of the control regions, it is also correlated across jet
multiplicity and leptonic channel. The shape uncertainty which uses the BDTr
method discussed in section~\ref{sec:ND-reweight} induces migration effects
across the analysis regions, however in order to increase the degrees of freedom
available to the profile-likelihood fit that systematic is taken as a shape only
effect. The migrations induced by the shape uncertainty agree well with those
derived from comparisons between nominal and alternative predictions, and the
sign of the final priors is determined by migration due to the shape
uncertainty. The magnitude of the prior is calculated as the quadrature sum of
the difference between the nominal prediction and \textsc{MadGraph} as well as
the scale and parton density function variations included in \textsc{Sherpa}.
There is no dedicated nuisance parameter to control the migration between the
$p_T^V$ regions of the analysis as this migration is controlled by the $p_T^V$
shape uncertainty.

\subsubsection{Flavour Composition Uncertainties}

% The $W$+hf background is composed of the contributions from the $bb$, $bc$, $bl$
% and $cc$ backgrounds; the relative composition of the various sub-components in
% the 1-lepton analysis regions after full reconstruction selection is summarised
% in Table~\ref{tab:wCOMP}. Uncertainties on the relative composition of these
% processes are estimated separately in the 1-lepton and the 0-lepton channels. A
% summary of the flavour composition uncertainties is reported in
% Table~\ref{tab:whf}. The full breakdown of the uncertainties is outlined in
% Appendix~\ref{app:wjets} of the previous version of this note at Ref.
% \cite{VHmodellingsupportnote}. These numbers have been recalculated using the
% new event categorization of the analysis and the full breakdown is outlined in
% the Appendix~\ref{app:wjets} of this note; however, since the \SHERPA2.1 samples
% for \textit{ckkw} and \textit{qsf} variations are not yet available, it was
% decided to keep the numbers used for the ICHEP 2018 publication.\\ The
% uncertainties are implemented as normalisation uncertainties on each of the
% smaller components ($bc$ [\texttt{SysWbcWbbRatio}], $bl$
% [\texttt{SysWblWbbRatio}], $cc$ [\texttt{SysWccWbbRatio}]) relative to the $bb$
% component.

% Full information on the uncertainty evaluation can be found in
% Appendix~\ref{app:wfcomp_CBAMVA}. The largest systematic variation between the
% regions comes from the comparison between \SHERPA2.2.1 and \MADGRAPH and is
% applied as a common variation in all the analysis regions. The same value is
% adopted for both the 2 and 3-jet bins as well as for the CR$_{\text{low}}$, SR
% and CR$_{high}$ fit regions. This approach is justified by the relatively small
% contribution of the non-$bb$ components after the 2 $b$-tag requirement which
% makes the impact of the choice of the correlation scheme negligible in the final
% fit.

% Variations of the flavour composition are also partly accounted by the shape
% uncertainty on the $m_{bb}$ distribution since the $W$+hf components have an
% intrinsically different $m_{bb}$ distribution\footnote{In particular differences
%   are observed between processes containing gluon splitting diagrams ($W$+bb and
%   $W$+cc) and processes not containing it ($W$+bc and$W$+bl).} as illustrated in
% Figure~\ref{fig:wjets_1lep_FlavComp_mBB}. These plots come from the studies

% \subsubsection{BDTr-based shape uncertainties}
% \label{subsubsec:WjetsBDTrBasedShapeSyst}

% A hybrid BDTr approach, as described in Section~\ref{subsec:ShapeMethod}, has
% been adopted in the 1-lepton and the 0-lepton channels to derive the BDTr-based
% shape systematics.

% \textbf{$p_T^V$ shape systematic}

% In each leptonic channel, eight shapes are derived depending on the jet category
% (2-jet and 3-jet) and flavour composition of the event. Only heavy flavours
% events ($W$+bb, $W$+bc, $W$+bl and $W$+cc) are considered as the $W$+l and
% $W$+cl background processes compose less than 1\% of the background in any
% region.

% In the 1-lepton channel, these shapes are obtained from a linear fit to the
% ratio between \SHERPA2.2.1 and \MADGRAPH  in the $p_T^V$ distribution with
% $p_T^V > 75$\ GeV. In the 0-lepton channel, the MET distribution with MET
% $>150$\ GeV is used.\\

% Figure~\ref{fig:wjets_1lep_2jet_SysWPtVBDTr} and
% Figure~\ref{fig:wjets_1lep_3jet_SysWPtVBDTr} shows $p_T^V$ shape systematics in
% the 1-lepton channel for each heavy flavour category and for 2-jet and 3-jet
% events, respectively.

% Given the low statistics in the 0-lepton channel, the $p_T^V$ shapes derived in
% the 1-lepton channel are also used in the 0-lepton channel. The goodness of this
% approach is showed in Figure~\ref{fig:wjets_01lep_2jet_SysWPtVBDTr} for the
% 2tag2jet category and in Figure~\ref{fig:wjets_01lep_3jet_SysWPtVBDTr} for the
% 2tag3jet region for each heavy flavour pair. An offset between the $p_T^V$ and
% the MET shapes in the two channels can be seen, especially in the $W$+bl events.
% This is due to the fact that the $p_T^V$ shape is derived from a unit-normalized
% ratio between \SHERPA2.2.1 and \MADGRAPH in the $p_T^V > 75$\ GeV  range, while
% the MET distribution is normalized to 1 in the MET $>150$\ GeV range. This is
% confirmed by the example plot in
% Figure~\ref{fig:wjets_01lep_2jet_bl_SysWPtVBDTr_From150} where both the $p_T^V$

% The $p_T^V$ shape systematic, derived in the 1-lepton channel, are thus applied
% to both the 1-lepton and the 0-lepton channel and implemented in the fit as a
% single nuisance parameter called \texttt{SysWPtV\_BDTr}.


% \textbf{BDTr shape systematic}

% %### HEAD ###
% %Prior the training, the nominal \SHERPA2.2.1 events are reweighted by the $p_T^V$  ratio with the alternative \MADGRAPH in each jet region and for each heavy flavour component. This ratio is exactly the one shown in blue in the bottom panel of Figure~\ref{fig:wjets_1lep_2jet_SysWPtVBDTr} and Figure~\ref{fig:wjets_1lep_3jet_SysWPtVBDTr} from which the $p_T^V$ shape uncertainty is derived through a linear fit. This allows to have a BDT shape systematic that does not account for the variance in $p_T^V$ .\\
% %Once the training and evaluation are performed for each jet category and heavy flavour pair, the ratio between the \SHERPA2.2.1 and \MADGRAPH BDT's distributions is found and used to define the BDTr-based systeamatic uncertainty. This is implemented in the fit as a nuisance parameter called \texttt{SysBDTr\_W\_SHtoMG5}.
% % >>> <<<
% Prior to the BDT training, the nominal \SHERPA2.2.1 events are reweighted by the
% $p_T^V$ density ratio with the alternative \MADGRAPH in each jet region and for
% each heavy flavour component. This thereby decouples the \ptv shape uncertainty
% from the  BDTr based shape uncertainty, where the aforementioned density ratio
% is implemented within the fit as a nuisance parameter called
% \texttt{SysWPtV\_BDTr} (see Section \ref{subsubsec:WjetsBDTrBasedShapeSyst}).\\

% Following the factorisation of the \ptv information, the \ptv weighted
% \SHERPA2.2.1 and \MADGRAPH samples are trained against each other using a
% classification BDT with the same inputs as those used in the main analysis MVA
% (as outlined in Ref. \cite{AlKhoury:2692011}). Upon completion of the training
% and evaluation of the BDT classifier for each jet category and heavy flavour
% pair, the density ratio between the \SHERPA2.2.1 and \MADGRAPH BDT's
% distributions is derived. This is then implemented as either a binned or
% continuous parameteric re-weighting function within the analysis, which then
% enters the profile likelihood fit as a nuisance parameter called
% \texttt{SysBDTr\_W\_SHtoMG5}.

% In Figure~\ref{fig:wjets_1lep_2jet_BDTrClosure_1}, the closure of the BDTr-based
% shape systematic on some of the key variables entering the analysis MVA is shown
% for the 1-lepton 2tag2jet category and for the $W$+bb events only. More plots
% showing the closure on the remaining variables and for $W$+bb, $W$+bc and $W$+bl
% events in the 1-lepton 2tag2jet category and the full set of plots for the
% 1-lepton 2tag3jet category can be found in the Appendix~\ref{app:wjets}. Small
% level of non-closure is found but is of no worry as the most important variables
% entering the Analysis-BDT, $p_T^V$ and $m_{bb}$, and the Analysis-BDT itself are
% fully covered by the BDTr-based shape systematic.

\input{07-systematic-errors/zjets-norm-table}
\input{07-systematic-errors/zjets-shape-yield-effect}

% An overview of the $Z$+jets normalisation systematics and their effect in the
% various analysis regions is reported in Table~\ref{tab:zjetsnorm}. The
% normalization uncertainties are derived as described in
% Section~\ref{subsubsec:vjetsUnc} and the full breakdown of the uncertainties
% is outlined in Appendix~\ref{app:zjets} of this note.

% The $Z$+l and $Z$+cl background processes are strongly suppressed by the
% requirement of 2 $b$-tags and as such compose less than 1\% of the background
% in any region. As such it is sufficient to apply a single normalisation
% uncertainty for each of these backgrounds, referred to as \texttt{SysZlNorm}
% and \texttt{SysZclNorm} respectively, which are individually correlated across
% all regions.

% Given the large uncertainty on the normalisation of the $Z$+hf processes, a
% floating normalisation is adopted separately for the 2-jet and 3-jet regions,
% \texttt{norm\_Zbb\_J2}, \texttt{norm\_Zbb\_J2}, which is heavily constrained
% by the large statistical population of $Z$+hf in the analysis signal regions,
% paired with the high $Z+$hf purity either side of the Higgs 110 GeV$<m_{bb}
% <$140 GeV mass window.

% Additional nuisance parameters have been introduced to model the extrapolation
% uncertainties on the relative normalisation across regions\footnote{While the
% prior is obtained comparing double ratios as explained, due to technical
% reasons, the effect of the uncertainty is applied to only one of the two
% regions considered in the double ratio. This choice does not affect the result
% but only the interpretation of the normalisation factor.}:

% \begin{itemize}

% \item \textbf{0-to-2 lepton}: An uncertainty (\texttt{SysZbbNorm\_0L}) on the
% ratio of the yields between the 0-lepton and 2-lepton regions derived as a
% double ratio; see Section~\ref{subsubsec:vjetsUnc} for details. This
% uncertainty is applied to the 0-lepton region, as a better constraint on the
% $Z$+hf prediction is obtained from the 2-lepton channel due to the higher
% $Z$+hf purity. The uncertainty is computed by comparing the $Z$+hf yield in
% the high \ptv\ regions of the two channels\footnote{The $Z$+hf normalisation
% factor is mainly determined in the low \ptv\ 2-lepton region, but the same
% low-high $Vp_{T}$ uncertainty will be considered for both the high $Vp_{T}$
% 2-lepton region and the 0-lepton SR.}.

% There are similar contributions to the total uncertainty from the comparison
% between \MADGRAPH and \SHERPA and the evaluation of the \SHERPA internal
% parameter variations. A detail breakdown of the uncertainty is documented in
% Appendix~\ref{app:z02lep}.

% \item \textbf{ [$\textrm{CR}_{\textrm{low}}$, SR,
% $\textrm{CR}_{\textrm{high}}$] Z $p_{T}$ Migration: }: An uncertainty
% (\texttt{SysZbbPTV}) on the $Z p_{T}$ distribution (see the following section
% \ref{sec:ZPtVAndMbbShape} for details) designed to vary the final MVA fit
% discriminant in each analysis region, also alters the relative event yield
% (normalisation) between the [$\textrm{CR}_{\textrm{low}}$, SR,
% $\textrm{CR}_{\textrm{high}}$] regions. The same systematic uncertainty
% derived from the 2-lepton data-driven approach is also applied in the 0-lepton
% channel.

% \item \textbf{ [$\textrm{CR}_{\textrm{low}}$, SR,
% $\textrm{CR}_{\textrm{high}}$] Z $m_{bb}$ Migration: }: An uncertainty
% assigned to the $\textrm{CR}_{\textrm{low}}$ and $\textrm{CR}_{\textrm{high}}$
% regions as gaussian constrained nuisance parameters with priors derived
% according to Section~\ref{subsubsec:vjetsUnc}. This uncertainty allows the
% event yield in the $\textrm{CR}_{\textrm{low}}$ and
% $\textrm{CR}_{\textrm{high}}$ regions to vary relative to the SR in a
% decorrelated fashion.
% \end{itemize}

% The full breakdown of the migration effect induced by the \ptv\ shape
% systematic in all the analysis regions and \ptv\ bins is reported in
% Table~\ref{tab:zjets_extrapolation_uncertainties_pTVRegions} for the 2-lepton
% channel and in
% Table~\ref{tab:zjets_extrapolation_uncertainties_pTVRegions_0Lep} for the
% 0-lepton channel.\\

\subsubsection{Flavour Composition Uncertainties}
\input{07-systematic-errors/zjets-flavour-comp}
% \paragraph{Flavour composition uncertainties}
% The $Z$+hf background is composed of the contributions from the $bb$, $bc$,
% $bl$ and $cc$ backgrounds. Uncertainties on the relative composition of these
% processes are estimated as summarised in Table~\ref{tab:zhf}. The
% uncertainties are implemented as normalisation uncertainties on each of the
% smaller components ($bc$ [\texttt{SysZbcZbbRatio}],$bl$
% [\texttt{SysZblZbbRatio}], $cc$ [\texttt{SysZccZbbRatio}]) relative to the
% $bb$ component.

% Different prior uncertainties have been adopted for the 0-lepton and 2-lepton
% channels; for the latter, separate uncertainties are also adopted for the
% 2-jet and $\geq$3-jet regions, but for each Z+hf sub-process the variations
% are considered as correlated across regions. %\textcolor{red}{There is no
% evidence of a strong dependence as a function of Z $p_{T}$ or $m_{bb}$, and so
% the same prior is applied to the $\textrm{CR}_{\textrm{low}}$, SR, and
% $\textrm{CR}_{\textrm{high}}$ fit regions} \footnote{ \textcolor{red}{This
% needs to be check with the new [$\textrm{CR}_{\textrm{low}}$, SR,
% $\textrm{CR}_{\textrm{high}}$] bins in the analysis} }.


% It should be noted that due to the 2 $b$-tag requirement non-$bb$ components
% are heavily suppressed, therefore the decision to correlate all flavour
% composition uncertainties across all fit regions mitigates the impact of the
% correlation scheme on the final fit result. Please also note that the heavy
% flavour priors, as given by Table \ref{tab:zhf}, are completely dominated by
% the difference between \SHERPA2.2.1 and \MADGRAPH; additional details can be
% found in Appendix~\ref{app:zFlav}.

% \paragraph{\ptv\ and \mbb\ shape uncertainties}
% \label{sec:ZPtVAndMbbShape}
\subsubsection{Shape Uncertainties}
\input{07-systematic-errors/zjets-shape-table}

% The $p^{V}_{T}$ and $m_{bb}$ shape uncertainties on the $Z$+jets process are
% obtained from a data-driven method within the 2 lepton channel (where the
% $Z$+jets purity is highest). Specifically, the $e^{\pm} \mu^{\pm}$ channel is
% typically the result of either $t\bar{t}/$single top background processes or
% fake electrons/muons from miss-identified leptons/jets. Consequently, the
% $e^{\pm}\mu^{\pm}$ region is a pure top ($t\bar{t}$/single top) control region
% (TopCR), where the kinematic properties of the $t\bar{t}$/single top
% sub-processes within the TopCR region matches that of the 2-lepton
% $e^{\pm}\mu^{\pm}$ SR+CRs; details regarding this can be found in Section
% \ref{subsec:ttbar}.


% Using this Top data-driven estimate, the $p^{V}_{T}$ and $m_{bb}$
% distributions obtained according to the procedure outlined in Section
% \ref{subsec:ttbar}, are subtracted from the data within the 2-lepton SR+CRs,
% in addition to the remaining $W$+jets and $VV$ MC predictions. The $Z$+jet MC
% prediction is then scaled to the data after subtracting off the non-$Z$+jet
% backgrounds as described previously. The discrepancy between the now modified
% data $p^{V}_{T}$/$m_{bb}$ distributions and the $Z$+jets MC prediction within
% the 2-tag SR+CRs corresponds to an assessment of the systematic uncertainties
% that one can assign to the $Z$+jets background process.


% In order to account for $VH$ signal and $VZ$ contamination, the $80$ GeV
% $<m_{b\bar{b}}<140$ GeV region is removed, such that all events vetoed are
% vetoed in this window when studying the $m_{bb}$ and $p^{V}_{T}$
% distributions. %Studies pertaining to $p^{V}_{T}$ biases induced by the
% removal of the $110$ GeV $<m_{b\bar{b}}<140$ GeV region can be found in
% Appendix \ref{app:zjets}.

% The data Monte Carlo comparison inclusively of the low (75-150~GeV), medium
% (150-250~GeV), and high (> 250~GeV)) $p^{Z}_{T}$ analysis regions for
% $p^{Z}_{T}$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:2lepptv_model} for the 2-jet, 3+ jet,
% and 2+ jet categories, whilst the $m_{b\bar{b}}$ data Monte Carlo comparison
% is shown for the low + medium + high $p^{Z}_{T}$ regions in Figure
% \ref{fig:2lepmbb_model} for the same 2-jet, 3+ jet, and 2+ jet categories.

% For the $p_T^Z$ and $m_{b\bar{b}}$ distributions the shape uncertainty is
% extracted by performing a $\chi^{2}$ functional fit in the $\geq 2$ jets
% category to the ratio of Data/MC. This category is chosen in order to maximise
% the MC and data statistics during the fit procedure thereby reducing the
% impact of statistical variance on the systematic error (2-jet and $\geq 3$ jet
% categories shown for completeness only). The shape uncertainties are indicated
% by the orange lines in the ratio of each figure, where the functional form and
% fit parameters are displayed on the top pane of each figure. The adopted shape
% systematic for the $p^{V}_{T}$ distribution has the parameteric form $y =
% -0.97.\textrm{log}_{10} (x/50000) + 1.06$, whilst for the $m_{bb}$
% distribution the parameteric form $y = 0.936 + 0.00000481x$ is used, where
% $x=\{p^{V}_{T},m_{bb}\}$ respectively.


% A summary of the $Z$+jets shape uncertainties are listed in
% Table~\ref{tab:vjetsSysSummary}, where it should be noted that the same
% parameterised uncertainties are also applied to the 0 lepton channel. With
% this in mind, it should be noted that the $m_{bb}$ observable is calculated
% using Anti-kT EMTopo $R=0.4$ jets prior to the application of the kinematic
% fit (see Ref. \cite{AlKhoury:2692011} for details), as the 0-lepton channel
% does not utilise the kinematic fit procedure.

% \paragraph{Shape systematic Uncertainties post-processing} 

% In the current systematic model, independent normalization factors are employed
% for the main backgrounds (\ttbar, $\Wboson +$HF and $\Zboson +$HF) independently
% in $2$ and $3(+)$-jet, above or below $$p_T^V$ = 150~\GeV$. Therefore, the
% extrapolation uncertainty is already accounted for at these boundaries. Most of
% the systematic uncertainties are computed in total $$p_T^V$$ phase space
% ($\geq75~\GeV$) in $2$-jet and $3$-jet events independently to avoid
% double-counting to the best possible. However, migrations at the $pTV=150~\GeV$
% are still possible, and differences in BDTr training and application setup or
% correlations could induce a small uncertainty componant accross jet bins. When
% visible, these effects are reduced with post-processing. The overall component
% of \ttbar ME, ttbar PS and \ttbar, $\Wboson +$HF, $\Zboson +$HF $p_T^V$
% uncertainties in the different jet bins, as well as in the bins
% $75~\GeV<$p_T^V$<150~\GeV$ and $$p_T^V$>150~\GeV$ is removed that way. \\


% Signal \mbb~shape uncertainty follow a similar but more refined treatment. In
% fact, the \VH signal is meant to have independent floating parameters in each
% STXS bin. Therefore, \VH~\mbb uncertainties are treated to have no overall
% impact in each jet and $p_T^V$ analysis bin, and act only as a shape on the
% discriminant, or as an extrapolation between signal and control regions. The
% same approach is adopted for di-boson \mbb uncertainties.

% \subsubsection{Smoothing of the Systematic Uncertainties}
% \label{sec:smooth}
% The uncertainties on reconstructed objects are propagated in the analysis in two
% different ways: by shifting weights, or by modifying the kinematic properties of
% the relevant objects and re-running the analysis chain. For flavour tagging,
% where a scale factor (SF) is used to correct efficiencies in the simulations to
% match those of data, the event weight is varied according to an upward
% (downward) shift of the SF and the change in the final distribution is noted as
% the +1 (-1) $\sigma$ uncertainties. For jet energy scale (JES) uncertainties,
% the jet energies are varied directly. Therefore events can migrate in and out of
% the analysis acceptance. Again the difference in the final discriminant is noted
% as the 1 $\sigma$ error. However, in the case of small variations and/or limited
% available MC statistics, the MC statistical uncertainty can make up a
% substantial part of this supposed systematic difference. Given that independent
% NP are introduce in the analysis to account for the MC statistical
% uncertainties, the inflation of systematic uncertainties due to limited
% statistic should be smoothed out.

% Two so-called ``smoothing'' algorithms are used to mitigate these effects. They
% have been developed for the Run 1 analysis and are based on the merging of
% consecutive bins in MC templates. Systematics templates are built as the ratios
% of varied to nominal MC templates. First, bins from one extremum to the next are
% merged until no local extrema remain in the BDT systematics template for the
% multi-variate analysis, or at most one extremum in the mbb systematics template
% for the cut-based analysis and well as the jet energy resolution systematics in
% the multi-variate analysis. This is an iterative process in which the merging
% performed at each step is chosen as the one for which the difference between
% merged and unmerged templates is smallest. Second, the bins resulting from this
% first algorithm are sequentially merged, starting from the upper end of the
% distribution, until the statistical uncertainty in each of the merged bins,
% calculated in the nominal template, is smaller than 5\%. In each of these merged
% bins, the nominal and systematically shifted contents are compared to give the
% $\pm1\sigma$ variation. This value is then used as the associated uncertainty
% for all the nominal bins in the corresponding merged bin.


% The smoothing procedure is applied to the uncertainties associated to:
% $e\gamma$, MET, muons, taus, jvt, jet, PRW and multi-jet modelling shapes. An
% example of the MET and JES systematics can be found in
% Figure~\ref{fig:Smoothing_Example}. The result of smoothing systematic
% uncertainties is checked to ensure that this is behaving as expected.

% \subsubsection{Pruning of the Systematic Uncertainties}
% \label{sec:smooth_prune}

% Several of the uncertainties described in Section~\ref{sec:npdefs} have a
% negligible effect on the distributions entering in the fit.  In addition,
% limited statistics in the MC nominal distributions can produce systematic
% templates with large fluctuations, introducing artificial variations in the fit.
% Therefore, following the Run 1 strategy, uncertainties are removed following a
% ``pruning'' procedure, which is carried out for each category/sub-channel in
% each region.

% Pruning is performed as follows: 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Neglect the normalization uncertainty for a given sample in a region if either of the
%   following is true:
 
%  \begin{itemize}
%   \item the variation is less than 0.5\%
%   \item both up and down variations have the same sign
    
%  \end{itemize}

% \item Neglect the shape uncertainty for a given sample in a given region if the
%   following is true:
  
%  \begin{itemize}
%   \item not one single bin has a deviation over 0.5\% after the overall
%     normalization is removed
    
%   \item if only the up or the down variation is non-zero and passed the previous
%     pruning steps
    
%  \end{itemize}

% \item An additional pruning is made to remove systematic effects on small
%   samples in all regions. In any given region, that pruning is only applied to
%   samples contributing to less than $1\%$ of the total background and reads as
%   follow:
  
%  \begin{itemize}
%   \item in low sensitivity regions (no bin with $S/B>2\%$), normalization
%     effects below $5$ per mille of the total backgrounds and shapes varying no
%     bin by more than $5$ per mille of the total backgrounds are pruned
    
%   \item in regions where at least one bin has a signal contribution $>2\%$ of
%     the total background, shape and normalization effects are pruned if they
%     generate yield variations in these bins smaller than $2\%$ of the signal
%     yields in these bins
    
%  \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

% The list of pruned uncertainties is regularly checked to ensure that this is
% behaving as expected. The value of the threshold is also tested and compared to
% no-threshold for each stable iteration of the fit. This to ensure no
% over-pruning is made and the analysis sensitivity is not artificially increased.
