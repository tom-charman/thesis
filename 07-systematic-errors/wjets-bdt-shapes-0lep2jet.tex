  \caption[Nominal, alternative and re-weighted nominal predictions of W + jets
  events (0--lepton channel, 2--jet category, MVA input variables).] {Histograms
    of the nominal predictions in the 0--lepton 2--jet region of variables
    entering into the analysis MVA are shown alongside the alternative
    predictions from \textsc{MadGraph} and the re-weighted nominal prediction.
    The $p_T^V$ shape systematic which was calculated in advance of the training
    is shown in green.}
