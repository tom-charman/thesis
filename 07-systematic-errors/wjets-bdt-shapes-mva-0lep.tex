  \caption{Histograms of the nominal predictions in the 0--lepton channel
    of the analysis MVA score are shown alongside the alternative predictions
    from \textsc{MadGraph} and the re-weighted nominal prediction. The $p_T^V$
    shape systematic which was calculated in advance of the training is shown in
    green. Only W + bb events are shown.}
