  \caption{Best fit values of the signal strength for the \WH\, \ZH\ and
    combined (Comb.$\equiv$\VH) processes. Uncertainties quoted are broken down
    by source, either statistical (Stat.) or systematic (Syst.). Uncertainties
    due to scale factors on background processes (referred to previously as
    floating normalisations), are included in the statistical uncertainty.}
