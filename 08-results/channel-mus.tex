  % Best values of the signal strength $\mu_{\VH}^{b\bar{b}}$ for the $0$-,
  % $1$- and $2$- lepton channels and their combination in the unconditional fit
  % to the Run 2 data of the three channels combined. The (black) total observed
  % uncertainty is quoted together with its decomposition in the (green)
  % statistical component, and systematic component. In this plot the uncertainty
  % due to background scale factors is included in the statistical component.
