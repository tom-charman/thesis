  \caption{Best fit values of the signal strength for the 0--, 1-- and 2--
    channels, as well as the combined (Comb.) measurement. Uncertainties quoted
    are broken down by source, either statistical (Stat.) or systematic (Syst.).
    Uncertainties due to scale factors on background processes (referred to
    previously as floating normalisations), are included in the statistical
    uncertainty.}
