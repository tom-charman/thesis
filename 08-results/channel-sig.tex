  \caption[Statistical significances of the background plus signal hypothesis
  broken down by analysis channel.]{Statistical significances for the background
    plus signal hypothesis for an Asimov dataset conditional on $\mu=1$, called
    expected and for the data, called observed. All values are given standard
    deviations ($\sigma$s). Significances are shown for a fit in each individual
    channel as well as the combined fit.}
