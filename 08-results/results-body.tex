\label{sec:mva-results}

\subsection{Nuisance Parameter Pulls}
Describe anything in the pulls and correlations that is particularly relevant to
the parts of the analysis that I worked on, V + jets systematics in particular.

Omit pulls of little significance referring to the internal note.

(+ add in chapter 6 brief description of the treatment of systematics in the
fit, i.e. what do we prune, state that there is smoothing and cite)
\input{08-results/pullcomp}

\subsection{Breakdown and Ranking of Uncertainties}
Show the breakdown and ranking of the uncertainties, explain briefly the physics
reasons why things appear where they do. Then later in conc. refer to how to
improve the analysis with reference to the breakdown.

\subsection{Post-fit Data Versus Predictions}
Describe agreement here.

\subsection{Signal Strength and STXS Measurements}
Show the signal strength measurements and STXS measurements, everything agrees
with the standard model so there is not much to state beyond that.

(+ add in chapter 6 mention the multiple POI version of the fit which yields the
STXS measurement, briefly describe what this is defining the Njet - NHjet
procedure to get the STXS bins, i.e. define the fiducial space)

\subsubsection{\VH\ Signal Strength Measurement}
Table~\ref{tab:sig_channels} shows the expected and observed significances for
the background plus signal hypothesis broken down by analysis channel.
\input{08-results/channel-sig}
The expected significances were determined using an Asimov dataset conditional
on $\mu=1$. All channels are approaching the 5$\sigma$ threshold to claim
discovery and the combined fit is well above the discovery threshold in
agreement with the previous result~\cite{vhbb-obs}. Figure~\ref{fig:channel-mus}
shows the best fit values for the signal strength in each channel and in the
combined paradigm.
\input{08-results/channel-mus}
All measurements are compatible with the standard model prediction of $\mu=1$,
the composition and values of the uncertainties affecting each channel are
similar with the 2--lepton channel being slightly more impacted by statistical
rather than systematic uncertainty.
%\input{08-results/uncorrelated-mus}

\subsubsection{\WH\ and \ZH\ Signal Strength Measurements}
Table~\ref{tab:sig_WZH} shows the expected and observed significances for
the background plus signal hypothesis for the \WH\, \ZH\ and \VH measurements.
\input{08-results/WH-ZH-sig}
The expected significances were determined using an Asimov dataset conditional
on $\mu=1$. The \WH\ stand alone measurement is approaching the 5$\sigma$
threshold to claim discovery. The \ZH\ stand alone measurement has surpassed the
threshold and the paper associated with this measurement is first proof of
discovery published. Figure~\ref{fig:WZH-mus}
shows the best fit values for the signal strength for each measurement.
\input{08-results/WH-ZH-mus}
All measurements are compatible with the standard model prediction of $\mu=1$,
the composition and values of the uncertainties affecting each channel are very
similar.
