\chapter{Results}%
\label{ch:results}
In this chapter the results of the \VHbb\ multi-variate discriminant fit are
shown. Other results such as those for the cross-checks of the analysis can be
found in~\cite{VHMainNote2019}. The fit is performed in accordance with the
asymptotic approximation~\cite{Cowan:2010js} for calculating the $p_0$ values
which are converted to statistical significances expressed in terms of standard
deviations. The Asimov dataset conditional on $\mu=1$, which is generated for
use in the above approximation, is used in a fit whose nuisance parameter pulls
are compared with the unconditional fit to the data that is used to generate the
final results. As per the prescription of the asymptotic approximation the
results will be discussed in the context of a hypothesis test comparing the null
hypothesis, the background only model, with the alternative hypothesis, the
background plus signal model.

My contributions to the results are as already stated in other chapters plus
running the combined, and 2--lepton channel fits to generate and study the
results at many key milestones in the publication timeline including the final
results in the paper~\cite{final-paper}.

\section{Nuisance Parameter Pulls}
Figure~\ref{fig:nppulls_012L_MVAVH_a} shows the nuisance parameter pulls coming
from the combined profile-likelihood fit for the $W+$jets, $Z+$jets and top
process backgrounds.
\input{08-results/pullcomp}
The other nuisance parameter pulls have been omitted but have been
studied~\cite{VHMainNote2019}. Observation of the pull on \texttt{SysZMbb} shows
that it is pulled towards the $+1\sigma$ value which meets the expectations
based on the shapes derived in section~\ref{sec:zjets-shapes}. The uncorrelated
component of the shape is also pulled in that direction but to a lesser degree
this also matches expectations. Several of the nuisance parameters relating to
the BDTr shape uncertainties are pulled to either $+1\sigma$ or $-1\sigma$ as
would be expected, whilst several have not been pulled much which goes against
naive expectations. There could be many explanations for this but as the phase
space is split up into many different regions limiting the statistical power of
the method it is best not to over-interpret. In order to understand the
behaviour of the modelling uncertainties on the $V+$jets processes previously
discussed these must be looked at in combination with the correlations between
nuisance parameter pulls shown in figure~\ref{fig:np-corrs}.

\section{Breakdown and Ranking of Uncertainties}
Table~\ref{tab:breakdown_012L_MVAVH} shows a breakdown of the impact of the
systematic uncertainties on the signal strength measurement.
\input{08-results/comb-breakdown}
It can be seen that the total statistical uncertainty (DataStat) has a smaller
impact that the uncertainties due to modelling and experimental sources
(FullSyst). Considering the systematic uncertainties, those coming from
experimental sources have a greater impact than those coming from the modelling
of the signal, which in turn have a greater impact  that those coming from the
modelling of the background. Further scrutiny of uncertainties on the signal
strength comes in the form of the ranking shown in
figures~\ref{fig:Rank_012L_MVAVH} and~\ref{fig:Rank_012L_MVAVH_nosig}.
\input{08-results/ranking}
It can be seen that the ranking is dominated by uncertainties on the signal. The
post-fit ranking which omits signal uncertainties is largely dominated by
flavour tagging uncertainties and scale factors for normalisation and acceptance
between analysis regions. The highest ranked uncertainty in both cases is the
$b$-tagging efficiency, this is unsurprising as $b$-tagging plays a crucial role
in the analysis selection.

Notably the $Z+$jets shape uncertainties do not appear in the top 15 sources of
uncertainty, naively this is unexpected as the background dominates in a
sensitive channel of the analysis. Improvements to the separation of the
$Z+$jets background and the signal in the analysis MVA due to the inclusion of
the $Z+$jets polarisation information is likely the reason for the shape
uncertainties not being as impactful as might be expected.

\section{Post-fit Data Versus Predictions}
Figures~\ref{fig:0lep2jet-postfit}, \ref{fig:0lep3jet-postfit},
\ref{fig:1lep2jet-postfit}, \ref{fig:1lep3jet-postfit},
\ref{fig:2lep2jet-postfit}, \ref{fig:2lep3pjet-postfit} show the post-fit data
versus prediction comparisons for each of the analysis channel, jet multiplicity
combinations. Each figure shows the individual analysis regions based on
$\Delta R(b, b)$ region and $p_{\mathrm{T}}^V$ bin. Across the board good
agreement between the data and prediction can be seen, supporting the fact that
our uncertainty model covers all of the differences between the two datasets and
the also supporting the background plus signal hypothesis.

\section{Signal Strength and STXS Measurements}
In this section the signal strength and STXS measurements will be detailed.

\subsection{\VH\ Signal Strength Measurement}
Table~\ref{tab:sig_channels} shows the expected and observed significances for
the background plus signal hypothesis broken down by analysis channel.
\input{08-results/channel-sig}
The expected significances were determined using an Asimov dataset conditional
on $\mu=1$. All channels are approaching the 5$\sigma$ threshold to claim
discovery and the combined fit is well above the discovery threshold in
agreement with the previous result~\cite{vhbb-obs}. Figure~\ref{fig:channel-mus}
shows the best fit values for the signal strength in each channel and in the
combined paradigm.
\input{08-results/channel-mus}
All measurements are compatible with the standard model prediction of $\mu=1$,
the composition and values of the uncertainties affecting each channel are
similar with the 2--lepton channel being slightly more impacted by statistical
rather than systematic uncertainty.
%\input{08-results/uncorrelated-mus}
\clearpage
\subsection{\WH\ and \ZH\ Signal Strength Measurements}
Table~\ref{tab:sig_WZH} shows the expected and observed significances for
the background plus signal hypothesis for the \WH\, \ZH\ and \VH measurements.
\input{08-results/WH-ZH-sig}
The expected significances were determined using an Asimov dataset conditional
on $\mu=1$. The \WH\ stand alone measurement is approaching the 5$\sigma$
threshold to claim discovery. The \ZH\ stand alone measurement has surpassed the
threshold and the paper associated with this measurement is first proof of
discovery published. Figure~\ref{fig:WZH-mus}
shows the best fit values for the signal strength for each measurement.
\input{08-results/WH-ZH-mus}
All measurements are compatible with the standard model prediction of $\mu=1$,
the composition and values of the uncertainties affecting each channel are very
similar.
\clearpage

\subsection{Simplified Template Cross-section Measurements}
Table~\ref{tab:sig_stxs} shows the expected and observed significances for
the \VHbb\ cross=section measurement in the each STXS bin. All bins show a high
degree of statistical significance. Figure~\ref{fig:5POI-mus} shows the best fit
values for the cross-section times branching ratio ($\sigma \times B$) in each
of the STXS bins.
\input{08-results/stxs-sig}
All measurements are compatible with the standard model predictions and are
weakly limited by statistical uncertainty. The theoretical uncertainty on the
standard  model prediction is greater for \ZH\ bins than for \WH\ bins.
\input{08-results/stxs-mus}
Figure~\ref{fig:5POI-corr} shows the correlation between each STXS bin, it can
be seen that no two bins are strongly correlated with one another. The lack of
correlation is largely due to the analysis categorisations which serve as
independent measurements of each STXS bin.
