\chapter{Results}%
\label{ch:results}
In this chapter the results of the \VHbb\ multi-variate discriminant fit are
shown. Other results such as those for the cross-checks of the analysis can be
found in~\cite{VHMainNote2019}. As my contributions were significant in the
modelling of backgrounds and the study of the profile-likelihood fit the
nuisance parameter pulls are included in this chapter. My contributions to the
results are as already stated in other chapters plus running the combined, and
2--lepton channel fits to generate and study the results at many key milestones
in the publication timeline including the final results in the
paper~\cite{final-paper}.

\section{Nuisance Parameter Pulls}
% Describe anything in the pulls and correlations that is particularly relevant to
% the parts of the analysis that I worked on, V + jets systematics in particular.

% Omit pulls of little significance referring to the internal note.

% (+ add in chapter 6 brief description of the treatment of systematics in the
% fit, i.e. what do we prune, state that there is smoothing and cite)
Figure~\ref{fig:nppulls_012L_MVAVH_a} shows the nuisance parameter pulls coming
from the combined profile-likelihood fit for the $W+$jets, $Z+$jets and top
process backgrounds.
\input{08-results/pullcomp}
In order to understand the behaviour of the modelling
uncertainties on the $V+$jets processes previously discussed these must be
looked at in combination with the correlations between nuisance parameter pulls
shown in figure~\ref{fig:np-corrs}.

\section{Breakdown and Ranking of Uncertainties}
Table~\ref{tab:breakdown_012L_MVAVH} shows a breakdown of the impact of the
systematic uncertainties on the signal strength measurement.
\input{08-results/comb-breakdown}
It can be seen that the total statistical uncertainty (DataStat) has a smaller
impact that the uncertainties due to modelling and experimental sources
(FullSyst). Considering the systematic uncertainties, those coming from
experimental sources have a greater impact than those coming from the modelling
of the signal, which in turn have a greater impact  that those coming from the
modelling of the background. Further scrutiny of uncertainties on the signal
strength comes in the form of the ranking shown in
figures~\ref{fig:Rank_012L_MVAVH} and~\ref{fig:Rank_012L_MVAVH_nosig}.
\input{08-results/ranking}
It can be seen that the ranking is dominated by uncertainties on the signal. The
post-fit ranking which omits signal uncertainties is largely dominated by
flavour tagging uncertainties and scale factors for normalisation and acceptance
between analysis regions. The highest ranked uncertainty in both cases is the
$b$-tagging efficiency, this is unsurprising as $b$-tagging plays a crucial role
in the analysis selection.

Notably the $Z+$jets shape uncertainties do not appear in the top 15 sources of
uncertainty, naively this is unexpected as the background dominates in a
sensitive channel of the analysis. Improvements to the separation of the
$Z+$jets background and the signal in the analysis MVA due to the inclusion of
the $Z+$jets polarisation information is likely the reason for the shape
uncertainties not being as impactful as might be expected.

\section{Post-fit Data Versus Predictions}
Figures~\ref{fig:0lep2jet-postfit}, \ref{fig:0lep3jet-postfit},
\ref{fig:1lep2jet-postfit}, \ref{fig:1lep3jet-postfit},
\ref{fig:2lep2jet-postfit}, \ref{fig:2lep3pjet-postfit} show the post-fit data
versus prediction comparisons for each of the analysis channel, jet multiplicity
combinations. Each figure shows the individual analysis regions based on
$\Delta R(b, b)$ region and $p_{\mathrm{T}}^V$ bin. Across the board good
agreement between the data and prediction can be seen, supporting the fact that
our uncertainty model covers all of the differences between the two datasets and
the also supporting the background plus signal hypothesis.

\section{Signal Strength and STXS Measurements}
%Results will be shown for the \VH\ signal strength measurement, the individual
%\WH\ and \ZH\ signal strength measurements and finally for the STXS measurement.
% Show the signal strength measurements and STXS measurements, everything agrees
% with the standard model so there is not much to state beyond that.

% (+ add in chapter 6 mention the multiple POI version of the fit which yields the
% STXS measurement, briefly describe what this is defining the Njet - NHjet
% procedure to get the STXS bins, i.e. define the fiducial space)

\subsection{\VH\ Signal Strength Measurement}
Table~\ref{tab:sig_channels} shows the expected and observed significances for
the background plus signal hypothesis broken down by analysis channel.
\input{08-results/channel-sig}
The expected significances were determined using an Asimov dataset conditional
on $\mu=1$. All channels are approaching the 5$\sigma$ threshold to claim
discovery and the combined fit is well above the discovery threshold in
agreement with the previous result~\cite{vhbb-obs}. Figure~\ref{fig:channel-mus}
shows the best fit values for the signal strength in each channel and in the
combined paradigm.
\input{08-results/channel-mus}
All measurements are compatible with the standard model prediction of $\mu=1$,
the composition and values of the uncertainties affecting each channel are
similar with the 2--lepton channel being slightly more impacted by statistical
rather than systematic uncertainty.
%\input{08-results/uncorrelated-mus}
\clearpage
\subsection{\WH\ and \ZH\ Signal Strength Measurements}
Table~\ref{tab:sig_WZH} shows the expected and observed significances for
the background plus signal hypothesis for the \WH\, \ZH\ and \VH measurements.
\input{08-results/WH-ZH-sig}
The expected significances were determined using an Asimov dataset conditional
on $\mu=1$. The \WH\ stand alone measurement is approaching the 5$\sigma$
threshold to claim discovery. The \ZH\ stand alone measurement has surpassed the
threshold and the paper associated with this measurement is first proof of
discovery published. Figure~\ref{fig:WZH-mus}
shows the best fit values for the signal strength for each measurement.
\input{08-results/WH-ZH-mus}
All measurements are compatible with the standard model prediction of $\mu=1$,
the composition and values of the uncertainties affecting each channel are very
similar.

\subsection{Simplified Template Cross-section Measurements}
Table~\ref{tab:sig_stxs} shows the expected and observed significances for
the \VHbb\ cross=section measurement in the each STXS bin. All bins show a high
degree of statistical significance. Figure~\ref{fig:5POI-mus} shows the best fit
values for the cross-section times branching ratio ($\sigma \times B$) in each
of the STXS bins.
\input{08-results/stxs-sig}
All measurements are compatible with the standard model predictions and are
weakly limited by statistical uncertainty. The theoretical uncertainty on the
standard  model prediction is greater for \ZH\ bins than for \WH\ bins.
\input{08-results/stxs-mus}
Figure~\ref{fig:5POI-corr} shows the correlation between each STXS bin, it can
be seen that no two bins are strongly correlated with one another. The lack of
correlation is largely due to the analysis categorisations which serve as
independent measurements of each STXS bin.
