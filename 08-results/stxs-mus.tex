  \caption[Best fit values for cross-section times branching ratio in each STXS
  bin.]{Best fit values of the cross-section times branching ratio ($\sigma
    \times B$) in each of the STXS bins. Uncertainties quoted are broken down by
    source, either statistical (Stat.) or systematic (Syst.). Uncertainties are
    broken down into either statistical (Stat.) or systematic (Syst.), with
    those due to scale factors on background processes counted as statistical.
    The theoretical uncertainty on the SM prediction of is shown in grey.}
