  \caption{caption}% Best values of the $\sigma\times \text{BR}$ normalized to the SM for
  % $\mathrm{WH}_{150-250}$, $\mathrm{WH}_{\geq 250}$, $\mathrm{ZH}_{75-150}$,
  % $\mathrm{ZH}_{150-250}$, and $\mathrm{ZH}_{\geq 250}$ in the unconditional fit
  % to data. The (black) total observed uncertainty is quoted together with its
  % decomposition in the (green) statistical component, and systematic component.
  % In this plot the uncertainty due to background scale factors is included in
  % the statistical component. The theoretical uncertainty on the SM prediction of
  % the $\sigma\times BR_{i}$ is shown as the gray area around $1$.}
