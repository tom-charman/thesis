  % Best values of the signal strength $\mu_{\VH}^{b\bar{b}}$ uncorrelated
  % (multi-$\mu$) between $N($jet$)$ regions (top left), \pTV regions (top right),
  % $N($jet$)$ regions and lepton channels (bottom left), \pTV regions and lepton
  % channels (bottom right) and their combination in the combined unconditional
  % fit to the Run 2 data. The (black) total observed uncertainty is quoted
  % together with its decomposition in the (green) statistical component, and
  % systematic component. In this plot the uncertainty due to background scale
  % factors is included in the statistical component.
